<p>“Come, you Jack Andrews, lave off your caperin’
about there, and give us that song the
Captain made on the bowld Guerilla,” said private
Mulligan to his comrade, who was taking a
lesson from Lance-Corporal Brogan on the Ballycraggen<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
pushing-step, to set his blood into circulation;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
for he had been just relieved from a two
hours’ stand upon the side of as bleak a mountain
as ever sentry stood upon; where the keen winds
of a cold frosty night had full play upon his patient
and good-humoured countenance.</p>

<p>“Make room, then, and let me have the next
place to the hob,” replied Jack. He was very soon
accommodated with the desired seat; for Andrews
was a good singer, and a still better story-teller:
he had seen a great deal of service, although
a young man, and from his uncommonly retentive
memory could detail the most minute circumstances
of his campaigns; he therefore was the
very life of the guard-room; and the men of the
regiment used to say, that if Jack Andrews and
Corporal Callaghan were but along with them,
they would not refuse two extra guards in the week.</p>

<p>The fire was soon surrounded, and Peninsular
Bob, the sergeant of the guard, bestirred himself
from his snooze in the old arm chair, right in front
of the hearth, to listen to the fine voice and admire
the musical taste of Jack Andrews.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Jack, “the song of ‘The Guerilla’
is a very sweet thing, when sung by two voices;
but without two it is not quite so good. Corporal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Callaghan knows it well, and has often sung it with
me; so as soon as he returns from relieving the
sentries, I’ll sing the song with him, if you can
persuade him to it. He knows the air better than
I do, for he learnt it from the Guerillas themselves
when there was a troop of them at Tolosa,
and I learnt it from him; but if you have no objection,
lads, I’ll sing a song which the Captain
wrote to a fine bold and romantic French air, which
I have heard the French soldiers singing many a
night, close to my own post.”</p>

<p>Of course, the proposal was received unanimously;
and when silence was perfectly restored, (for
all spoke on the subject at once,) Jack Andrews
sang the following song, first having taken the precaution
of shutting the door, lest he might happen
to be heard outside although there was very little
danger of being surprised by any of the officers in
his melodious dereliction from strict military practice.</p>

<h3>THE SENTINEL.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When o’er the camp the midnight moonlight beams,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And soldiers’ eyes are seal’d in happy slumber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wakeful sentinel his watch proclaims,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And silence sweetly swells the echoing number:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
<span class="i2">Oh! then to Heaven his eyes he turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And murmurs with a glowing sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Angels bright that dwell above,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Tell my country, tell my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For them&mdash;for them I watch, for them I’ll die!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, as the foe’s night-fires before him play,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His bosom swells with flames still stronger burning;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gazes on them&mdash;wishes for the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With glory and the fight once more returning!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh! then to Heaven his eyes he turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And murmurs with a glowing sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">“Angels bright that dwell above,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Tell my country, tell my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For them&mdash;for them I’ll fight, for them I’ll die!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And should he, in the battle’s raging heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With valiant heart and arm the foe confounding;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! should the hero then his death-wound meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Victory his glorious knell be sounding,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Again to Heaven his eyes he turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And murmurs with his life’s last sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">“Angels bright that dwell above,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Tell my country, tell my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For them&mdash;for them I fought, for them I die!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This, sung in admirable style by the manly
voice of Jack Andrews, had a powerful effect upon
the listeners, for the air was of a romantically martial
character, composed during the best days of
Napoleon’s glory, when chivalric enthusiasm infused
itself into every shade of French imagination.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
There was not a man of the guard who had
not served in the Peninsula during the brightest
period of England’s military grandeur, when she
stood opposed to Napoleon’s greatest heroes; and
from a recollection of the scenes of that time,
awakened by the song, there arose a feeling in
every breast around the humble hearth of Ballycraggen
Guard-house, which commanders might
have envied, and philosophers admired. It
brought all back to the romance of war; it placed
them in situations familiar to their fancy; it
touched the most delightful chord of the soldier’s
heart, and every tongue became eloquent upon the
source of its sensations. There is no sign in Nature’s
mnemonics like music: it is a talisman of
power. Moore has beautifully expressed this in
poetry, but not so effectually as the following
lines, attributed to the unfortunate Ensign Dermody.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To him whose heart is dark with shades of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweet’s the melody it loved to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In days gone by! Yet bitter is the strain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! ’tis a mingling of delight with pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, though the hand of Time well-nigh efface<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each blur and furrow&mdash;each deforming trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which stern Adversity’s harsh hand design’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spoil the lively landscape of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
<span class="i0">Some passing sound, some melancholy lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The favour’d pleasure of some former day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls on his soul; and, as the listener hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth comes the magic stream of memory’s tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, dropping on the picture, bright again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enlivens alike each beauty and each stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Casting a varnish of so mix’d a dye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That (by its gloss) ’twill please yet pain the eye!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bob the sergeant spoke more than any one else
on the subject of the song;&mdash;“That’s a ’nation
good thing, Jack,” said he; “it puts me in mind
of many a one of my night-guards when I was a
private. D&mdash;me but it made me think I was on the
side of a hill on the advanced-posts, stuck behind
a tree, or the corner of a rock, watching the enemy
in the moonshine of a fine summer’s night,
just as I was immediately before the first battle Sir
Arthur ever fought in Portugal. I think I’m
there now: it was at Roliça. I was on sentry
that night, on a hill, close to the enemy. It was
as fine and as calm a night as ever was seen.
The French were posted thick upon the heights in
front of us&mdash;infernal steep and craggy precipices,
where it was almost impossible to come at them.
There was I about three hundred yards in front of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
them. On this advanced-post I was the sentry,
and was just leaning against an old windmill,
looking out at the French vidette, who was stuck
on horseback, like the statue at Charing Cross,
right out upon a high rock, at the top of a hill.
The moon was rising behind him, and I could see
the figure of the fellow and his horse just like one
of those black shadows they cut out in card. The
whole country round was one of the most beautiful
pictures in the world. Down under my eyes was
a little wood of lightish-coloured trees, (cork, I
believe,) a small stream at the end of it: all along,
to the distance of about two miles, I could see
different old convents, and houses beset with
orange and olive-trees; and the moonlight threw
such a beautiful colouring over them that I could
not help feeling melancholy.&mdash;You may smile,
lads, but I was a young man then, and only a few
days in a foreign country: I could almost smell
the sea-air; for we were only three miles from the
beach, along which we had been so lately sailing:
I had not been many weeks away from a comfortable
home&mdash;father, mother, sweetheart and all: I
was then standing between two great armies, ready
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
to start upon each other: and I did not know but
the next day would see my first fight and my last
hour. I’ll leave it to any man here, who ever
was in any thing like such a situation, to say,
whether it is not calculated to make an impression
on the feelings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by my sowl! and that it is, sargeant,” replied
private Mulligan; “particularly when you
are not a long time at the work.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the sergeant, “it was at
that old windmill I heard the song of ‘The Sentinel’
first, from one of the enemy, who was sitting
with four or five others on the top of one of the
heights; and when he was done, a crowd of our
fellows, about two or three hundred yards from
me, gave him three rounds of applause. The
night was so still, that you could hear the cocking
of a musket half a mile off, and the song went
most melodiously. God knows whether the poor
fellow ever sang another song! for the next day
there was no singing, but plenty of dancing, to
the tune of ‘<i>over the hills and far away</i>,’ and I
rather think we made the French pay the piper.”</p>

<p>“Bluranouns! tell us how it <i>was</i>, sargeant,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
exclaimed Mulligan, with an anxious smile, and a
chuckling twist of his hands. The sergeant was
not sorry to have such a favour asked of him, and
he did not lose a moment in complying with the
request, which now became general.</p>

<p>“After I was relieved that night, I lay down
in my guard-coat on some Indian-corn straw, behind
a wall or sort of pent-house, where our advanced
piquet was, and I slept a couple of hours;
after which Tom Singleton and I smoked a little
while, out of a short stump of a pipe, which
Tom brought with him from England, and warmed
our gobs with a drop out of the canteen.
It was broad daylight, and we got up to look out
at the heights over the wall; for the officer of
the piquet was very busy with his spy-glass reconnoitring,
and we knew we were soon to begin
a little bit of business with the Mounseers.</p>

<p>“Every body thought Sir Arthur would not let
us be long before we should be ordered to be ready,&mdash;for
he looked like a sharp one. We had not been
many minutes leaning over the wall, when we saw
the blue fellows moving along the height immediately
in front of us, as if to take up a position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
on their own extreme left; and, presently, four
or five officers&mdash;I suppose the General and his staff&mdash;appeared
where the vidette was posted, and
planted an eagle-flag on the highest point of the
hill; after which all drew their swords, took off
their hats, and saluted it. Thinks I, ‘Sir Arthur
will pay his addresses to that same flag before
long.’ The French General took damned good
care to place the eagle on the top of a rock, where
the boys could not <i>scale her nest</i> very easily.</p>

<p>“The piquet was very soon after relieved; and
when we had been with the bivouac of our regiment
about a couple of hours, we were all ordered
out under arms, along with the other regiments of
the brigade. ‘Ho, ho!’ says I to my comrade,
‘there will be something going on very quickly,
you may depend upon it.’ We stood behind a
line of loose trees and bushes quite covered from
the enemy’s view. I could see that other brigades
were also under arms, at about a quarter of a
mile off; in short, between every opening of either
walls, or woods, or houses, upon each plain and
little open hill within view, I could see the red
coats either drawn up like ourselves, or moving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
along at quick time with their arms and accoutrements
glistening like glass. All the army seemed
on the alert&mdash;several pieces of artillery passed us
down the road towards the front, and Sir Arthur
himself was galloping about with his staff giving
directions. He once stopped behind a small
house along with General Crawford, who commanded
us, and showed him a large map, as if pointing
out something very important; after which <i>our</i> General
came back to where the brigade was, under
the trees, and talked for ten minutes or so to
Colonel Lake, our commanding officer, (God rest
his soul, he was not long alive after that!) I
could see by the men’s faces and their manners,
that they expected something which was strange
to them; but still they were joking and laughing:
the officers were uncommonly pleasant, particularly
the young ones. It was a most delightful
morning&mdash;only a little too hot; but we were under
the trees, and tolerably well shaded from the effects
of the sun. A Portuguese muleteer just then
came out from a sandy narrow lane, with a pannier
full of grapes and oranges, and the men at
the flank of the regiment where I was, were helping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
themselves to the welcome fruit, which they purchased
for little or nothing, when an Aid-de-camp
came galloping down the road behind where
we were formed, and spoke a few words to General
Crawford; then galloped away again. We were
helping ourselves to the grapes and oranges, which,
with our bread, made a good breakfast, when the
word was given “<i>attention</i>,” and the feast was at
an end. The whole of the brigade instantly formed
into close column, and we moved out towards
the front, still covered by the wood, and were
joined by three other brigades, all forming into
one solid column. As we marched on, there was
not a word spoken, except an occasional command
from the officers. We knew not what was to be expected;
but guessed, from seeing a brigade of artillery
not far on our right, ready at their guns, silent
and waiting the word. There seemed to be scarcely
a breeze or a fly to disturb the silence of that fine
summer’s day, and the business upon which all
were engaged:&mdash;an awful silence it was&mdash;nothing to
be heard but the soft tread of our feet, as we moved
over the heath, and the grass, and the sand.</p>

<p>We were now halted&mdash;still in the wood; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
within half-shot of the heights; and the French
guns were not idle whenever any of our forces
were to be seen; but we were completely covered.
Two other brigades now joined us, and the whole
of us were formed into one close column. A
finer body of fellows never stood together. We
did not halt many minutes; and during these few
minutes the General officers and staff were very
busy&mdash;riding up and down the column, and giving
orders, as coolly and as calmly as if they were in
the barrack-yard; but their countenances were expressive
of a seriousness, which I never saw upon
a parade&mdash;they seemed as if they were not now
<i>playing</i> soldiers, but on the point of going to
work like good ones. Our Colonel now addressed
us in a short but striking manner. He hoped we
would show that the regiment was worthy its
name. I think his eye met every one of ours. I
never saw a man say so much by his looks in my
life:&mdash;we all knew what he meant, and although
we could not speak our mind, we showed it by
our faces. I know the tears came into <i>my</i> eyes,
and I did not know why; for I could have jumped
into a mortar’s mouth at the time, and taken a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
mile’s ride on a shell; but the fact is, it was the
brotherly kindness Colonel Lake felt for us, and
the pride he took in the old 29th, which affected
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, faith!” said Mulligan, “It’s not always
grief nor sorrow that makes a body’s eyes wathery,
sargeant.”</p>

<p>“Well, the moment all was ready, there was
nothing but a dead silence. Every man&mdash;Generals
and all&mdash;were in their places. A minute or two
would take the column out from the wood, and
then ‘ware hawk’ from the guns on the heights.
‘Steady, men,’&mdash;‘Forward!’ The curtain was
soon up. Bang went the artillery of the French&mdash;right
into our column, as it poured out from the
wood; and <i>rattle</i> went our artillery on the right
also, to support us. We moved on steady towards
the bed of a stream (quite dry) that winded up
the hill: it was about as broad as this room;
and so steep that we must have bent a good deal
to have got up it: through this passage we
were to go and make our way up to the French
fellows. On we moved for about three hundred
yards under the fire, without being much injured;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
at all events, it did not make a great difference in
our column, although I stood upon three or four
poor fellows as I advanced, who had fallen. I
could see on my left, at a good distance, a large
body of our troops moving on also; and this gave
us still more confidence. We were getting vexed
from the fire above by the time we got to the
passage up the hill, and our fellows began to swear
vengeance against the Mounseers. If we could
have got up in any numbers at once, I really think
we would have eaten the damned rascals; but we
were obliged to go&mdash;not more than four or five
abreast; and had to stumble our way over
lumps of stones as big as the big drum. Our
orders were to get up as fast as possible, and form
above as soon as we had made good our ground.
We scarcely lost a man killed or wounded in going
up the hill through the crags and stones, until we
came nearly to the top. Here the way was a little
wider, and our Colonel formed us up in a pretty
fair sort of way, giving us the word to advance
at double-quick time; when out comes a volley
from a green mound of earth in front of us and
right in the middle of the way. This mound was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
covered with bushes, and from behind these the firing
came: it was by a set of riflemen who were
posted there in ambush: but when they fired they
ran like devils back&mdash;every one of them, except a
few that fell on their faces; for we gave them a
volley that knocked them over in good style.
Several of my comrades dropped at this point, and
our poor Colonel too. He laid himself up against
the side of the bank, and although scarcely able
to breathe, smiled, and pointed with his sword to
go on. We never stopped, but mounted like tigers
to the top, although half a regiment let slap at us
from the opening. Oh! if they had only stood
till we could have got our bayonets into them! but
they ran off to about a hundred yards distance,
and in a few moments our regiment and two others
were up and formed as compactly as you please,
when we received another volley from the French, at
both sides and in front&mdash;thick as hail. Many of our
men fell, but we closed up, and did not miss them.
‘<i>Let us at them</i>,’ was heard from many mouths.
Vexed and impatient, we soon had the word
‘<i>Charge!</i>’ The French were in full line, and so
were we: they advanced to meet us like men,&mdash;damned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
beardy, tall, raw-boned grenadiers, with
long grey frock-coats and red-worsted epaulettes.
On we went; and when within about ten yards of
them, we all gave a yell,&mdash;‘Hurrah!’ and Oh,
Christ!&mdash;We dashed at them,&mdash;they huzza’d as
well as ourselves; but in a moment every English
bayonet was bloody to the hilt. Over they went;
and the rear-rank of the French, although they
stood a little, and did some execution, was soon
settled. We butted them when we were tired
sticking them. I broke my musket by a blow I
made at a fellow, and missed him; but I jumped
at his throat, although he was a tall man, and pulled
him right down; however, there I left him, and
ran after my regiment; for he lost his musket,
and must have been taken prisoner by the troops
advancing into the field. The French, now at our
right and left, opened a fire on us, which knocked
many a poor fellow off the hooks, and we fell back
to the main-body of our troops; for we were only
treating the enemy with a few steel lozenges, while
the remainder of the column was getting up the
hill; and how they got up so soon I cannot imagine.
I did not think we were five minutes at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
work in all, when I turns and sees the whole column
formed in line, and the right of it pelting
away, volley after volley, at the French, who now
showed an immense front. It was a sort of even
ground enough, but covered with grape stumps,
and loaded with bunches; however the <i>grape-shot</i>
was of more consequence to me, so I never minded
touching the grape <i>fruit</i>. There was nothing done
for half an hour but banging away with the musketry
and a few of the French guns; but while
this was going on, our men were getting up the
hill, and forming in our rear as fast as possible.
Men were dropping, both French and English,
quick enough, I assure you; and we were longing
for another charge, to put an end to the peppering.
This we were soon indulged with. ‘<i>Steady, my
lads</i>,’ was the cry from the officers, ‘<i>another taste of
the bayonet</i>.’ The French formed a strong first line,
and their battalions in the rear were forming into
a second. ‘Now, men,’ says a General who rode
behind <i>our</i> first line, ‘keep steady, and do your
duty.’&mdash;‘Charge!’ was the word:&mdash;in a moment
we were not forty yards from the enemy.&mdash;‘Hurrah!’&mdash;Oh
such a shout as we gave! But it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
answered by the French every bit as loud; and
they did not flinch. At them we went, like devils
again; and down they went like twigs. They found
it was no use trying it,&mdash;they were knocked about;
and although they did as much as men could do,
they were obliged to start about (those that were
not down) and make the best of their way off.
We halted and loaded, as steady as rocks&mdash;most
of our gun-barrels were streaming with
blood, which wetted the powder as it went in.
I’m sure that was <i>my</i> case; for when we gave
them a volley, I know my musket did not go
off, so I threw it away, and took up another
from one of our poor fellows, who lay on his
face behind us, with his head knocked all
to pieces. I’m certain it was Jem Ellis, by a
ring on his finger; but you didn’t know Jem,
poor fellow! that ring was given to him by a sweet
little girl the day we embarked, and he intended
to marry her if God spared his life; but unfortunately
he met his fate with a cannon-ball. Well,
after this second charge, we expected an attack
from the French cavalry; and they certainly came
upon our right; but made no impression. Just as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
we halted, after scattering the line of the enemy,
their General came galloping in amongst his men,
roaring out to them to rally; it was General Laborde;
and at that moment, a battalion on my
left poured in a round upon them; but still they
formed up in good style: one of the balls hit
the General: he alighted, and sat down beside a
bank: we could see the surgeons tying up the
wound. There was not much harm done him, for
he mounted again and rode away along the line.
At this time we were getting pretty well used to
the business, and the men stood as quiet as logs,
wiping their faces, and damning the French; yet
the firing continued as brisk as ever; and although
our first engagement, we went on just as if we
were at a review: whenever a poor fellow dropped,
we closed up, and kept our front complete. In a
moment I sees, left and right of the field, at about
half a mile distant, our red boys moving in towards
us: they had got round on the enemy’s flanks&mdash;the
sight was glorious. We now got the word
for another charge, and went to it as confident of
success as if we were going to upset a parcel of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
skittles; but we had much harder work; for the
French rather stunned us with a volley just as we
approached: however we closed up, and pegged
away, right and left, huzzaing and roaring like
madmen. Away they ran, and we after them,
until we were ordered to form up again: I was
just falling in, when I felt my right leg very heavy
and numbed like, and rather difficult to move; I
put down my hand to my ankle, and found my
stocking soaked with blood, but I felt no pain. In
a few moments, by George! I could not move my
leg at all; so I very reluctantly sat down under a
rising bank, pulled off my shoe, and was obliged to
cut off my stocking: I was hit, sure enough, right
through the fleshy part of my leg, and I felt it
now impossible to move. There was a general
shout down on the right, and I could see our battalions
advancing in double-quick time; the staff
galloping about everywhere; and a brigade of artillery
of ours blazing away like hell-fire at the enemy.
Several regiments passed by me in columns
and in high spirits; so that I knew the French
were retiring: I gave them three cheers as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
passed,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> in which I was joined by my wounded
comrades, lying about, and several of the lads
threw us canteens of rum and wine, which were
very acceptable. I gave a poor French fellow a
drop out of one of them, and I do think it saved
his life; he shook hands with me, and said something
in French, I suppose to thank me: he looked
like a ghost before he took it, and after he lay
down a bit, his face got its natural colour, and he
seemed much stronger. Here we all lay until near
seven o’clock in the evening; the field covered
up and down with wounded, dying and dead. I
lost sight of the troops in about an hour after I
fell; but I had no doubt they settled the matter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
very soon, for the artillery could not be heard in
a short time after the advance. I talked as
well as I could to the poor French grenadier beside
me, and we seemed happy to speak together,
although not understanding much what each other
said, except by signs. About six o’clock I sees a
Portuguese fellow, with a great slouched hat,
poking about amongst the dead, and rifling
them of money, watches, clothes, and whatever he
could get. A French officer who lay upon a
sort of rise was attacked by this fellow: the
officer was a powerful man, and resisted being
robbed, although he could not stand up. I had
no idea what the rascal of a Portuguese meant
to do; when I saw him hit the officer with an
immense pole, on the head, and the unfortunate
man fell flat. There was an English sergeant
of the 91st regiment near me, severely wounded,
and says I to him, ‘Sergeant, do you see that?’ ‘I
do,’ says he. ‘Have you a musket near you?’ says
I. ‘Yes, here is one,’ says he. ‘Then keep it, and
load,’ says I, ‘for I’ll knock that fellow over with
mine.’ The sergeant loaded while lying down, having
got a cartridge from a pouch of a dead man near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
him:&mdash;‘Are you ready?’ says I. ‘Yes.’ ‘Then
if I miss him, and he should come up to us,
wait till he is close&mdash;then make sure of him.’
The Portuguese had now left the Frenchman,
and was engaged at a dead English officer: he
was stooping down. I raised myself up, and
leaned my musket on the French grenadier’s
shoulder to take good aim&mdash;I covered my mark,
and fired:&mdash;the rascal jumped two feet off the
ground, roared out ‘Ai! Jesus!’ and dropped
like a cock on his face. He did not lift his
long-pole again, I warrant you.</p>

<p>“In a very short time after this, a detachment
arrived on the ground, to take away the wounded,
and the surgeons had us removed into a house
where there was plenty of straw&mdash;French, English,
and all together. From the men who took
us off the field, I learned that the enemy were
completely beaten, and retired, leaving their artillery
behind.</p>

<p>“This was the very first brush our troops
had under Sir Arthur, and for beginners, I
never saw better boys in my life. In about five
days after this, they had another trial, at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
battle of Vimiera; and I wish I had not been
wounded so soon, or I should have had a finger in
the pie.</p>

<p>“This was before you came to our regiment,
Sergeant&mdash;wasn’t it?” said Jack Andrews.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the sergeant, “I was drafted
into this corps two years after that battle.”</p>

<p>“It was a right good shot you made at
the Portuguese scoundrel?” said Mulligan; “By
the powers o’ Moll Kelly, you sarved him right;
an’ if it was my case, I’d just a’ done the self
same thing. The rascals used to follow the army,
whenever there was a likelihood of a battle, an’
not only rob, but murdther the wounded. The
Spaniards were no betther;&mdash;ay, an’ what’s worse
than all that, some of our own army’s women, at
the battle of Vittoria, were seen doin’ the same
thing. Several of them were caught in the act
by the provost, an’ flogged well, though they <i>were</i>
women,&mdash;an’ the devil’s cure to them for it.”</p>

<p>“Hush&mdash;I think the sentry has challenged.
Here comes Callaghan,” said the Sergeant, listening:
and the word “Halt!” outside, convinced
him that he was right in his conjecture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>The Corporal, with four men as cold as the
weather without, now entered the guard-house,
and joined their comrades at the fire. They
brought with them a stranger, an exciseman,
whose face was somewhat disfigured; and the
Corporal informed the Sergeant, that some countrymen,
who kept a private still, had attacked
him, and would perhaps have killed him but
for the guard who were within call. “Captain
Jones met us,” said Callaghan, “an’ desired me
to conduct this man safe to the guard-house; an’
said that he would send the ordtherly officer down
to you with further ordthers. The man is supposed
to be very active about private stills here;
an’ this is the way they have rewarded him.&mdash;Pon
my sowl, Sir, you got a hell of a dthrubbing.”</p>

<p>“I think I did,” returned the exciseman; “but
I’ll make them pay for that through the nose,
please the pigs.”</p>

<p>The orderly officer now entered the guard-room,
and directed the Sergeant to take three
men of the guard, and to conduct the exciseman
safely home across the mountain; for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
which the latter returned thanks. The party
set out immediately, and the orderly officer returned
to his quarters; while Corporal Callaghan
took a snooze in the Sergeant’s chair, during his
absence.

GONE TO SEA IN A COACH.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Ay; now we see it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there’s the coach!&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Southey.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In many, if not in most, of the regiments of
our army, there is to be found a sort of officer
who is a privileged oddity,&mdash;who takes liberties
with all his brethren of the mess with impunity,
and who pockets every thing short of a blow with
the best possible humour. In general, the individuals
of this description are designated in the mess-room
vocabulary, “<i>Good-tempered Old Stagers</i>,”
and “<i>Old Stickers</i>,” meaning thereby, that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
can “go” at the bottle, and “stick” at the table
till “all’s blue.”</p>

<p>One of these, a Quartermaster of infantry, with
a nose of the genuine Bardolph complexion, a rosy
and eternal smile, a short figure, and a big head,
having dined with a party of brother officers at
the <i>Three Cups</i>, Harwich&mdash;the day on which his
regiment marched into the barracks of that town&mdash;was
in the best possible spirits: so much so, that
he gave the bottle no rest until about eleven
o’clock; and became “glorious,” just as the
company broke up&mdash;right or wrong he <i>would</i>
go along with three of the youngest subalterns to
ramble by the sea-side in the moonshine, having
been “<i>so long i’ the sun</i>.” They permitted him
reluctantly; perhaps, indeed, because they could
not prevent him; but when the party got down
to the place where passengers and goods are
usually embarked, the Quartermaster became
totally overpowered, and sank senseless into a
snore. The officers whom he accompanied could
not think of carrying his <i>corpus</i> back to the inn;
nor were there any persons near whom they could
employ for the purpose: one of them, therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
opened the door of a private carriage which stood
near, “unshipped” from the wheels&mdash;ready for
embarkation, and in a moment the sleeper was
bundled into it, where he was left to his repose
with the door fast shut upon him.</p>

<p>Next morning at daybreak (about three o’clock)
the coach, with its contents, was put on board the
Hamburg packet, and stowed away at the very
bottom of the hold: in half an hour after this,
the vessel put to sea.</p>

<p>For the whole of the day the packet had a
brisk breeze, and at midnight was a good hundred
miles away from Harwich: a dead calm set
in. It was a beautiful night in July, and the
passengers were not all gone to bed: some walked
the deck, and others sat below at cards&mdash;every
thing was silent, except the rattling of the ropes
as the ship yielded to the smooth and gentle swell
of the sleeping North Sea. About this time, the
Quartermaster, it is supposed, awoke; at least he
had not been heard before to utter his complaints,
probably from the bustle consequent on the managing
of the vessel in a stiff breeze. However,
it was at this time that his cracked and buried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
voice first fell upon the ears of the crew; and for
about twenty minutes the panic it created is indescribable.
The whist company in the cabin, at
first thought it was one of the sailors in a chest,
and called the captain; who declared he had been
that minute examining into the cause of the unearthly
sounds, and had mustered his crew, all of
whom were on deck, as much astonished as he was&mdash;nay,
more so, for one of them, a Welshman,
felt convinced that the voice proceeded from the
speaking trumpet of the ghost of David Jones,
his former shipmate, “who had died in ill will
with him.”</p>

<p>“Hallo&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o!”&mdash;“Murder!”&mdash;“Murder!”
now rose upon all ears, as if the voice were
at the bottom of the sea. The Welshman fell
upon his knees, and begged forgiveness of his injured
and departed friend, David Jones: the rest
of the crew caught a slight tinge of his fears, and
paced about in couples to and fro; some declaring
the voice was below the rudder, and others
that it was at the mast-head. The passengers,
one and all, hurried on deck; in short, none on
board, not even the Captain and the oldest seaman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
were free from alarm: for they had searched
every <i>habitable</i> place in the vessel without discovering
the cause of their terrors, and the hold, it
was evident, could not have contained an extra rat,
it was so crammed with luggage, &amp;c. “Let me
out, you d&mdash;&mdash;d rascals! let me out&mdash;let me out,
I say!” screamed the voice with increased vigour.
These exclamations the Welshman declared were
addressed to devils, that were tormenting his
deceased enemy David; and he uttered a fervent
prayer for the peace of the wandering and unhappy
soul: but a different idea was awakened in the
mind of the Captain by the words “<i>Let me out</i>,”
“There is somebody packed up in the hold,” exclaimed
he; and instantly ordering the men to follow
him down, all began to remove the upper
layer of articles; which being done, the voice
became louder and more distinct.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” bawled the Captain.</p>

<p>“I’m here in a coach, d&mdash;&mdash;n you!” answered
the Quartermaster.</p>

<p>The mystery was now solved, and the Welshman
made easy; but no one could imagine how a
human being could have got <i>into</i> the carriage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
However, satisfaction on this point was not to be
waited for; so the men fell to work, and after
about half an hour’s hard exertion, succeeded in
disincumbering the vehicle. They then proceeded
to unpack the Quartermaster, whose astonishment
amounted almost to madness, when he found that
he had not only been confined in a coach, but in
a ship, and that the said ship was then in the
middle of the German Ocean!</p>

<p>It was impossible to put back to Harwich, so
no remedy was left the little fat gentleman but to
proceed to the end of the voyage, and to take a
passage back from Hamburg as soon as possible.
This was bad enough; but his hopes of an early
return were almost destroyed by the setting in of
adverse winds, which kept the vessel beating about
in a most bile-brewing and stomach-stirring ocean,
for ten days and nights; during which time, when
not sea-sick, the Quartermaster was employed in
profoundly meditating <i>how</i> he could have got into
the coach; and even after having taken the opinion
of the captain, the crew, and all the passengers,
upon the matter, he felt himself as much
in the dark as ever. The last thing he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
recollect of “the land he had left,” was that he
dined and <i>wined</i> at the “Three Cups,”&mdash;what followed
was chaos.</p>

<p>But the worst of the affair, decidedly, was that
the day on which he had been <i>put to sea</i> was the
22d of the month, and as it was impossible for him
to make his appearance with his regiment on the
24th, he knew he must, as a matter of course, be
reported “<i>Absent without leave</i>” at head quarters,
and that he would most probably be <i>superseded</i>.
This reflection was even worse than the weather
to the Quartermaster, though the rough sea had
already almost “brought his heart up.” However,
he had great hopes of being able to join his
regiment on the 10th of the following month&mdash;the
next <i>return-day</i>&mdash;and, by due application, he
thought he might contrive to prevent supersession.
Ten days of this time was, however, consumed
before he set a foot upon the German shore, and
then only half of his excursion was over: all his
hopes rested upon a quick passage back to Harwich.
This, however, the Fates denied him; for
having drawn on the agent&mdash;got the cash&mdash;engaged
his passage to England&mdash;laid in sea-stock, and all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
things necessary&mdash;the packet, just as she was leaving
Hamburg, was run foul of by a five-hundred-ton
ship, and so much injured that she was obliged
to put back, and the unfortunate Quartermaster
was thus compelled to wait a fortnight for another
opportunity of returning to England. He not
only was delayed beyond the 10th (return-day)
but beyond the following 24th, and when he <i>did</i>
arrive, he found that he had been not only superseded
by the Commander-in-chief, but considered
dead by all his friends and relations!</p>

<p>However, on personally applying for reinstatement,
he obtained it, and once more joined his old
corps at Harwich, where he many a night amused
the mess with the recital of his trip to sea in the
coach; which was always given with most effect
when he was <i>half-seas-over</i>.

<span class="author"><i>Lee.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Parade, Sir!&mdash;Parade, Sir!&mdash;There’s a
parade this morning, Sir!”</p>

<p>With these words, grumbled out by the unyielding
leathern lungs of my servant, I was
awakened from an agreeable dream in my barrack-room
bed one morning about a quarter before
eight o’clock.</p>

<p>“Parade!”&mdash;I reflected a moment;&mdash;“Yes,”
said I, “<i>a punishment</i> parade.”</p>

<p>I proceeded to dress; and as I looked out of
my window I saw that the morning was as gloomy
and disagreeable as the duty we were about to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
perform. “Curse the punishment!&mdash;curse the
crimes!” muttered I to myself.</p>

<p>I was soon shaved, booted, and belted. The
parade-call was beaten, and in a moment I was in
the barrack-yard.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers were marching
their squads to the ground: the officers, like myself,
were turning out: the morning was cold as
well as foggy: and there was a sullen, melancholy
expression upon every man’s countenance, indicative
of the relish they had for a punishment
parade: the faces of the officers, as upon all such
occasions, were particularly serious: the women
of the regiment were to be seen in silent groups at
the barrack-windows&mdash;in short, every thing around
appealed to the heart, and made it sick. Two
soldiers were to receive three hundred lashes each!
One of them, a corporal, had till now preserved a
good character for many years in the regiment;
but he had been in the present instance seduced
into the commission of serious offences, by an
associate of very bad character. Their crimes,
arising doubtless from habits of intoxication, were,
disobedience of orders, insolence to the sergeant on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
duty, and the making away with some of their
necessaries.</p>

<p>The regiment formed on the parade, and we
marched off in a few minutes to the riding-house,
where the triangle was erected, about which the
men formed a square, with the Colonel, the Adjutant,
the Surgeon, and the drummers in the centre.</p>

<p>“Attention!” roared out the Colonel. The
word, were it not that it was technically necessary,
need not have been used, for the attention of all
was most intense; and scarcely could the footsteps
of the last men, closing in, be fairly said to have
broken the gloomy silence of the riding-house.
The two prisoners were now marched into the
centre of the square, escorted by a corporal and
four men.</p>

<p>“Attention!” was again called, and the Adjutant
commanded to read the proceedings of the
court-martial. When he had concluded, the Colonel
commanded the private to “<i>strip</i>.”</p>

<p>The drummers now approached the triangle,
four in number, and the senior took up the “<i>cat</i>”
in order to free the “tails” from entanglement with
each other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>“Strip, Sir!” repeated the Colonel, having observed
that the prisoner seemed reluctant to obey
the first order.</p>

<p>“Colonel,” replied he, in a determined tone,
“I’ll volunteer.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>“You’ll volunteer, will you, Sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes; sooner than I’ll be flogged.”</p>

<p>“I am not sorry for that. Such fellows as you
can be of no use to the service except in Africa.
Take him back to the guard-house, and let the
necessary papers be made out for him immediately.”</p>

<p>The latter sentence was addressed to the Corporal
of the guard who escorted the prisoners,
and accordingly the man who volunteered was
marched off, a morose frown and contemptuous
sneer strongly marked on his countenance.</p>

<p>The Colonel now addressed the other prisoner.</p>

<p>“You are the last man in the regiment I could
have expected to find in this situation. I made
you a corporal, Sir, from a belief that you were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
a deserving man; and you had before you every
hope of farther promotion; but you have committed
such a crime that I must, though unwillingly,
permit the sentence of the court which tried
you to take its effect.” Then turning to the Sergeant-major,
he ordered him to cut off the Corporal’s
stripes from his jacket: this was done, and
the prisoner then stripped without the slightest
change in his stern but penitent countenance.</p>

<p>Every one of the regiment felt for the unfortunate
Corporal’s situation; for it was believed that
nothing but intoxication, and the persuasion of the
other prisoner who had volunteered, could have
induced him to subject himself to the punishment
he was about to receive, by committing such a
breach of military law, as that of which he was
convicted. The Colonel, himself, although apparently
rigorous and determined, could not, by all
his efforts, hide his regret that a good man should
be thus punished: the affected frown, and the
loud voice in command, but ill concealed his real
feelings;&mdash;the struggle between the head and the
heart was plainly to be seen; and had the head
had but the smallest loophole to have escaped, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
heart would have gained a victory. But no alternative
was left; the man had been a <i>Corporal</i>,
and, therefore, was the holder of a certain degree
of trust from his superiors: had he been a private
only, the crime might have been allowed to pass
with impunity, on account of his former good
character; but, as the case stood, the Colonel
could not possibly pardon him, much as he wished
to do so. No officer was more averse to flogging
in any instance, than he was; and whenever he
could avert that punishment, consistent with his
judgment, which at all times was regulated by
humanity, he would gladly do it. Flogging was
in his eyes an odious punishment, but he found
that the <i>total</i> abolition of it was impossible; he
therefore held the power over the men, but never
used it when it could be avoided. His regiment
was composed of troublesome spirits; and courts-martial
were frequent: so were sentences to the
punishment of the lash; but seldom, indeed, were
those punishments carried into execution; for if
the Colonel could find no fair pretext in the previous
conduct of the criminal, to remit his sentence,
he would privately request the Captain of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
his company to intercede for him when about to
be tied up to the triangle; thus placing the man
under a strong moral obligation to the officer
under whose more immediate command he was:
and in general, this proved far more salutary than
the punishment ever could have done.</p>

<p>It is not <i>flogging</i> that should be abolished in
the army, but the cruel and capricious opinions
which move the lash. Humanity and sound judgment
are the best restrictions upon this species of
punishment; and when they are more frequently
brought into action than they have formerly been,
there will be but few dissentient opinions upon
military discipline.</p>

<p>The prisoner was now stripped and ready to be
tied, when the Colonel asked him why he did not
volunteer for Africa, with the other culprit.</p>

<p>“No, Sir,” replied the man; “I’ve been a
long time in the regiment, and I’ll not give it up
for three hundred lashes; not that I care about
going to Africa. I deserve my punishment, and
I’ll bear it; but I’ll not quit the regiment yet,
Colonel.”</p>

<p>This sentiment, uttered in a subdued but manly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
manner, was applauded by a smile of satisfaction
from both officers and men; but most of all by
the old Colonel, who took great pains to show the
contrary. His eyes, although shaded by a frown,
beamed with pleasure. He bit his nether lip; he
shook his head&mdash;but all would not do; he could
not look displeased, if he had pressed his brows
down to the bridge of his nose; for he felt flattered
that the prisoner thus openly preferred a
flogging to quitting him and his regiment.</p>

<p>The man now presented his hands to be tied up
to the top of the triangle, and his legs below: the
cords were passed round them in silence, and all was
ready. I saw the Colonel at this moment beckon
to the surgeon, who approached, and both whispered
a moment.</p>

<p>Three drummers now stood beside the triangle,
and the sergeant, who was to give the word for
each lash, at a little distance opposite.</p>

<p>The first drummer began, and taking three
steps forward, applied the lash to the soldier’s
back&mdash;“<i>one</i>.”</p>

<p>Again he struck&mdash;“<i>two</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>Again, and again, until <i>twenty-five</i> were called
by the Sergeant. Then came the second drummer,
and he performed his twenty-five. Then
came the third, who was a stronger and a more
heavy striker than his coadjutors in office: this
drummer brought the blood out upon the right
shoulder-blade, which perceiving, he struck lower
on the back; but the surgeon ordered him to
strike again upon the bleeding part: I thought
this was cruel; but I learnt after, from the surgeon
himself, that it gave much less pain to
continue the blows as directed, than to strike upon
the untouched skin.</p>

<p>The poor fellow bore without a word his flagellation,
holding his head down upon his breast,
both his arms being extended, and tied at the wrists
above his head. At the first ten or twelve blows,
he never moved a muscle; but about the twenty-fifth,
he clenched his teeth and cringed a little
from the lash. During the second twenty-five,
the part upon which the cords fell became blue,
and appeared thickened, for the whole space of
the shoulder-blade and centre of the back; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
before the fiftieth blow was struck, we could
hear a smothered groan from the poor sufferer,
evidently caused by his efforts to stifle the
natural exclamations of acute pain. The third
striker, as I said, brought the blood; it oozed
from the swollen skin, and moistened the cords
which opened its way from the veins. The Colonel
directed a look at the drummer, which augured
nothing advantageous to his interest; and on the
fifth of his twenty-five, cried out to him, “Halt,
Sir! you know as much about using the cat as
you do of your sticks.” Then addressing the
Adjutant, he said, “Send that fellow away to
drill: tell the drum-major to give him two hours
<i>additional</i> practice with the sticks every day for a
week, in order to bring his hand into&mdash;a&mdash;proper
movement.”</p>

<p>The drummer slunk away at the order of the
Adjutant, and one of the others took up the cat.
The Colonel now looked at the Surgeon, and I
could perceive a slight nod pass, in recognition
of something previously arranged between them.
This was evidently the case; for the latter instantly
went over to the punished man, and having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
asked him a question or two, proceeded formally
to the Colonel, and stated something in a
low voice: upon which the drummers were ordered
to take the man down. This was accordingly
done; and when about to be removed to the regimental
hospital, the Colonel addressed him thus:
“Your punishment, Sir, is at an end; you may
thank the Surgeon’s opinion for being taken down
so soon.” (Every one knew this was only a pretext.)
“I have only to observe to you, that as
you have been always, previous to this fault, a
good man, I would recommend you to conduct
yourself well for the future, and I promise to hold
your promotion open to you as before.”</p>

<p>The poor fellow replied that he would do so,
and burst into tears, which he strove in vain to
hide.</p>

<p>Wonder not that the hard cheek of a soldier was
thus moistened by a tear; the heart was within his
bosom, and these tears came from it. The lash
could not force one from his burning eyelid; but
the word of kindness&mdash;the breath of tender feeling
from his respected Colonel, dissolved the stern soldier
to the grateful and contrite penitent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>May this be remembered by every commanding
officer, when the cat is cutting the back of the soldier!
May they reflect that both the back and
the heart have feeling; and that the tear of repentance
is oftener brought from the culprit’s eyes by
kindness than by the lash!

OF THE LATE MORRIS QUILL.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Few indeed are there in the army who have
not heard of Morris Quill; and fewer still are
they who have known a better man, or a merrier
companion. He was a medical officer of the
31st regiment&mdash;an Irishman, with one of the
softest, soundest, and most gentlemanly brogues
that ever eulogised a bottle of genuine port, or
asked a favour from a wealthy widow’s lip. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
was a fine portly, good-humoured looking, summer-faced
son of Erin, with that sort of fun about
him which, if it did not injure himself, carried no
sting to the bosom of any body else, except when
his wit was directed to the operation of crushing
some impudent coxcomb; and then it left its penal
effects with him who deserved them. He is now
no more, poor fellow! He died at Cork a short
time ago, and his <i>last march</i> was attended by all
the military (both half and full pay) in the city
and its vicinity. His memory still lives; and so
long as there shall be a gallant Peninsular hero to
sit at a mess-table, the eccentricities and whims of
Morris Quill can never be forgotten. The few
which I recollect will be recognized as genuine by
all those officers who served in the Duke of Wellington’s
army. I knew him: I have known his
friends: I have seen and heard of most of his
drolleries; and from the many I select the few
which follow.</p>

<p>For the purpose of creating hilarity, Morris
would often affect the greatest simplicity of Irish
manners when strangers were at the mess-table.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
He would on those occasions tell such anecdotes of
himself, as were calculated to make him appear but
little removed from barbarism; and this always
afforded the highest degree of enjoyment to those
who were by, most of whom knew that he was
any thing but a barbarian. I was once present
when he played off this whim in a most laughable
way. There were several very prim and “<i>monstrous</i>”
important gentlemen dining at the mess&mdash;perfect
strangers to any thing like a joke, and
equally so to Quill.</p>

<p>As soon as the bottle was fairly adrift, Morris
seized an opportunity of gravely addressing the
President. “Colonel,” said he, “I received a
<i>letther</i> to-day from my <i>ould</i> mother in Kerry.
Just read the direction on it. I’m sure ’tis plain
enough, and yet it has been two months coming.”
The letter was handed about the table, and the
officers read aloud the address to the perfect astonishment
of the visitors.</p>

<p>“<i>To Misther Docthor Morris Quill, Esquire.
Along with Lord Wellington’s fighting army in
France, or Spain, or Portingale, or maybe elsewhere,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
and the Western Indys. From his loving
mother.</i>”</p>

<p>The gravity with which he managed this piece
of humour, excited the mirth of all his companions,
at the expense of the strangers, who looked
very contemptuously on Morris, when they saw
this specimen of the family education. However,
before they left the table, all was explained, and
Quill reinstated in their good opinion.</p>

<p>Morris had served in a regiment before he
joined the 31st; and one of his old brother-officers
having met him in Dublin, shortly after the exchange,
asked him why he did not stay with his
old friends?&mdash;“Oh, I’ll tell you then,” replied
Morris. “You see I have a brother in the 32d,
and I wanted to be near him in the wars, so I
changed into the 31st, which you know is as close
as possible to his regiment.” At this time they
happened to be two thousand miles asunder.</p>

<p>With all the apparent simplicity which Quill
exhibited, he was as good a judge of politeness,
and knew as well the difference between gentlemanlike
familiarity and impertinent freedom, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
any man in the army; which the following anecdote
will in a great measure prove. He exchanged
from the 31st, after having been a long time in
the regiment, for no other purpose but to be
attached to one about to go on actual service, in
order that he might have a better chance of promotion.
On joining, he had in his pocket letters
from all those officers of his old corps who had
happened to be acquainted with those of the one
into which he exchanged; but he did not take the
trouble to present a single one, lest they would
suppose, as he said himself, that he wanted them
to give him a dinner. In a few days after his
joining, a very supercilious officer of the regiment,
no less a personage than one of the majors, met
him in the mess-room, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, and after a little
conversation, put a very impertinent question to
Morris. “Pray, Sir,” said he, “were not you a
considerable time in the 31st?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I was, ’faith.”</p>

<p>“It is a very good corps indeed&mdash;very good
corps. I wonder you did not remain in it! Pray,
what made you leave it, Sir?”</p>

<p>Morris hesitated a little, and then replied:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
“Why, ’faith, I don’t like to mention exactly the
reason, Major.”</p>

<p>“God bless me! what was it?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, Major, I know you are a gentleman
every bit of you; and if you will solemnly
pledge me your honour that you will never mention
it to any body, I’ll tell you the whole affair.”</p>

<p>“’Pon my honour, I won’t. I pledge you my
honour, I will not mention it.”</p>

<p>“’Pon your <i>honour</i>,” said Morris emphatically.</p>

<p>“’Pon my <i>honour</i>!” echoed the Major.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s enough,” observed Morris; “I’ll
tell you all about it. But shut the door, Major.”&mdash;The
Major obeyed and hurried back to his chair.&mdash;“Well,
then, you see, when I was in the 31st, I
owed a little money here and there; and I was
bothered with duns&mdash;Oh! the 31st was a fine
regiment; it was there we had plenty of credit
wherever we went: more is the pity for me; because
I just&mdash;one day that I was short of a little
money”&mdash;(<i>whispering</i>)</p>

<p>“Well, Sir!” interrupted the Major.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;a&mdash;just&mdash;a&mdash;put a few of the mess-table
spoons and silver forks into my pocket;&mdash;that’s all.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>“Indeed!” observed the Major, drawing back
his chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” continued Morris; “and a fellow
there, dressed up in livery (they call him the
mess-waiter), saw me do it, and stopped me before
the officers;&mdash;so I was obliged to leave the
regiment; for the colonel was a civil fellow, and
let me off without a court-martial.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!&mdash;ho&mdash;hum&mdash;&mdash;Good morning, Sir,”
<i>politely</i> replied the Major, and left the room.</p>

<p>Of course a thing of this kind was not suffered
to lie hidden under a bushel half an hour by the
Major. He proceeded instantly to the Colonel,
and gravely laid open to him the alarming discovery.
The Colonel lost not a moment in calling a
meeting of the mess. The mess assembled (all
excepting Morris, to whom the meeting was not
made known, for obvious reasons), and the Major,
in an energetic speech, informed the mess that he
had heard the fact from Mr. Quill’s own lips, with
that gentleman’s solemn injunction upon the Major
to be secret. All were equally astonished and alarmed;
each man put his hand instinctively to his fob;
and a little attorney-faced captain despatched his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
servant to see if his trunks were all safe. The <i>mad
dog</i> had got amongst them, and there was but one
opinion about his expulsion.</p>

<p>Morris was sent for forthwith:&mdash;the orderly-serjeant
was despatched to tell him that the Colonel
and the members of the mess were assembled,
and that he was to attend immediately.</p>

<p>The <i>delinquent</i> appeared without the least hesitation,
and looking as pleasantly as ever. On
being informed by the Colonel of the cause of the
meeting, he paused, cast his eyes archly at the
Major, and exclaimed, “Ah! Major, Major! so
you have told on me, though you pledged your
<i>honour</i>!” (<i>Not a word from the Major.</i>) “Now,
Colonel, the fact of the matter is this: I was asked
a question by that gentleman, which, however
he might have meant it, I could not receive but as
a joke (a little too free, I must say), and so I&mdash;just
answered him as the joke deserved. The Major, in
a way I did not much relish, asked me, ‘<i>What was
the reason I quitted the 31st?</i>’ and I gave him an
answer. It was a question of an odd meaning,
and so I gave him an odd reply.” (<i>A stare and a
smile from all except the Major.</i>) “Now,” continued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Morris, pulling out a bundle of letters,
“there’s a letter for you, Colonel; and one for
you, Captain Smith; and for you, Captain Jones;
and for you, Lieutenant Edwards:”&mdash;so on,
until he delivered the bundle of introductions
which he brought from his last regiment. The
letters were read aloud, and better fun was never
enjoyed in the mess-room, nor relished with greater
zest before or since; even the Major

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Join’d in the laugh that almost made him sick;”<br /></span>
</span></span>

and Morris became the favourite of every officer
in the regiment, always excepting the <i>honourable</i>
Major himself.</p>

<p>At one period of the Peninsular war, the army
was several months in arrear of pay. Money was
not to be got anywhere by the advanced troops,
except in the class of Generals and higher officers.
Morris Quill was, of course, one of those whose
purses were empty&mdash;indeed there was not a dollar
to be <i>caught</i> in the regiment from right to left.</p>

<p>A general officer was passing with his staff
(General Crawford, I believe) through the village
in which Morris was quartered. As soon as he
saw the General, he turned to a brother officer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and said, “By J&mdash;&mdash;! I’ve a great mind to ask the
General for a few dollars.”</p>

<p>“That you may do,” replied the officer; “but
I’m sure you will not get them.”</p>

<p>“Will you bet me £5 I don’t?” returned
Morris.</p>

<p>“I will bet you £5 you do not borrow £5 or
20 dollars from <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“Done. I’ll bet you a bill on the paymaster.”</p>

<p>“Done.”</p>

<p>“Done&mdash;and I’ll <i>dine</i> with him too,” said
Morris, as he started off on his poney. He
trotted up to the General: taking off his hat in
the most “official” manner,&mdash;“General,” said he,
“I beg your pardon&mdash;I have to mention to you
that my sick are without any <i>comforts</i>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>&mdash;they
will be in a bad way if I cannot buy something
for them; and I have no money at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Quill, that is a very unfortunate
thing. How much money will be enough for
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! about 20 dollars, Sir; and if you will
lend that sum to me, I will give you an order on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Cox and Greenwood for the money; which you
can send over, and it will be just the same thing
to you.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Quill. Come to my quarters,
and you shall have the money.”</p>

<p>Morris jogged off with the General about two
miles to his quarters; and during the time they
were going, the General found him a very pleasant
and humorous fellow. Morris, as he was
receiving the money, mentioned something about
the scarcity of provisions, and concluded by saying,
“Faith, General, I don’t know when I had
a dinner, or even saw the ghost of one: there is
a very savoury smell here, I can perceive; but that
is a <i>General</i> thing, I suppose, in this quarter.”</p>

<p>The General without hesitation asked Morris to
stay to dinner; and highly enjoyed his society
during the evening.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock before he returned; when
producing the cash, he convinced his friend and
the other officers of his success; so they finished
the night over a cigar and a bottle of ration grog.</p>

<p>Quill, during the whole time he served in the
Peninsula, had a servant who was as whimsical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and as humorous as himself. This servant, he
used to say, was “the best caterer for a gentleman’s
table in hard times, that ever came from
Kerry.” And so he was; for Morris Quill had
always a fowl or a sucking pig for dinner, when
the rest of the officers (except those who dined
with Morris) were obliged to be contented with a
biscuit and a bit of hard beef. Indeed, so excellent
a purveyor and cook was Dennis, that his
master made it a practice to ask his friends to dine
with him, without (<i>of himself</i>) knowing where
the eatables were to come from. “Dennis,” he
would say, “I am going to ask a couple of gentlemen
to dine with me to-day&mdash;indeed I <i>have</i>
asked them already. What have you got?”</p>

<p>“Oh musha! Docthor Quill, I don’t know that
I have any thing, barrin’ a shouldther o’ vale and a
hen or two.”</p>

<p>(A shoulder of veal! and a brace of fowls!
when they were starving!&mdash;no bad things.)&mdash;Or,
perhaps, as it might happen, Dennis would say,
“Faith! Masther, I havn’t a toothful in the
place, barrin’ the rashions.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>“Well, Dennis, get what you can. Try, can
you <i>buy</i> any thing about the country?”</p>

<p>(<i>Buy</i>, indeed! and not a sixpence in the whole
division!)</p>

<p>Morris and his friends would come to dinner at
the usual hour, perfectly confident that Dennis had
done his duty; and, perhaps, a good pair of fowls,
or a piece of pickled pork, or a sucking pig, would
welcome their longing appetites.</p>

<p>“Where did you buy these things, Dennis?”
Quill would ask.</p>

<p>“O! plase your honour, up there above&mdash;over
the hill&mdash;down there, at a farm-house yondther.”</p>

<p>“You’re <i>sure</i> you <i>bought</i> them, Dennis?”</p>

<p>“O yes; I ped for ’em, Sir&mdash;that is, I offered
the money to the farmer; but he said, ‘Never
mind, Dennis,’ says he, ‘it will do another time.’
So I mane to pay the next time I go.”</p>

<p>“Very well, very well, Dennis; so as you <i>paid</i>
for the provision, it’s all well; but take care the
Provost doesn’t give you your <i>change</i> one of these
days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that, Sir; the Portuguese hereabouts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
all knows me very well, and wouldn’t mind
if I never ped them a vintin.”</p>

<p>And they had a right to know Dennis,&mdash;at least
their <i>live stock</i> had; for there was scarcely a fowl,
rabbit, pig, sheep, or calf in the country, that he
had not paid his respects to. Dennis used to say,
“We are here starvin’ and fightin’ for the Portuguese;
so the laste they may do, is to give us our
dinner, <i>at any rate</i>.”</p>

<p>The last anecdote of this singular character,
which I recollect, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A very hot engagement had taken place, in
which the 31st regiment had been hard at work.
Quill had his instruments, &amp;c. under a hedge in a
valley; at a little distance from the hill which
his regiment was endeavouring to take from the
French. He stayed pretty near the corps, (for Morris
was no flincher,) and one of his brother officers
being wounded in the leg, he ran over to him to
render what surgical assistance he could. It was
necessary to have something from the medicine-chest,
which was behind the hedge in the valley,
and Morris started off like a hare, to fetch it. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
this moment the regiment was suffering from grape-shot,
and the Brigadier-General, who was coming
at a gallop along a narrow lane, saw Quill running,
inside a hedge, as fast as he could, away from the
regiment, in the uniform of which he was; and,
thinking it was some cowardly officer who feared
the grape, the General cried out to him, “Where
are you going, Sir?” To which Morris only replied,
still running under the hedge, “By J&mdash;&mdash;s!
I won’t stay any longer there; it’s too hot.” The
General again cried out to him, and ordered his
aid-de-camp to follow, and march him back a prisoner;
but Morris outran the aid-de-camp’s horse,
and arrived before him at the hedge where his
instruments were. When the latter saw who it
was, he well nigh fell off his horse with laughing,
as he galloped back to tell the General his mistake.
Morris laughed heartily, too; and, indeed,
he had the laugh all on his own side, as he returned
with the medicaments for which he had
gone, to assist his wounded brother officer, and
with which he ran as fast <i>into</i> the field as he had
run <i>out</i> of it.

<p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The Depôt Mess-room at Winchester&mdash;a
tolerably large apartment, more airy than comfortable;
neither carpet nor curtains.&mdash;Dinner so
so.&mdash;Wines of excellent</i> <small>MANUFACTURE</small>.&mdash;<i>Company,
consisting of fifteen officers, (mostly youths)
of different regiments, and of course in different
uniforms.&mdash;Attendants, three recruits in undress,
(white flannel,)&mdash;no band; but several dogs barking
and scudding about the lobby</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ensign Newly.</i> By G&mdash;d, I never sat down to
so d&mdash;d a dinner in my life; we get worse and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
worse every day: the fish smells infernally, and
this hash is made of the hard mutton we had on
table last Thursday. Simple, my boy, give us a
<i>sample</i> of that old cock turkey before you, if you
can get a knife into him.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Simple.</i> I can’t carve. (<i>In a whisper.</i>)
Captain Alder, will you cut the turkey? I never
carved in my life.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Alder.</i> Very well, Mr. Simple, I’ll try
my skill. Hand that turkey this way, John.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>One of the attendant recruits takes the dish of
turkey, and in making an unnecessary circuit
of the table, flaps down upon his face; the
dish is smashed, and the turkey rolls to the
far end of the mess room, followed by streams
of gravy and the regrets of the company.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ensign Newly.</i> O, curse you for a clodhopper!
Run after the turkey, you rascal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>John runs and takes up the turkey, but drops it
immediately.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lieut. Short.</i> What do you drop the turkey
for, Sir, eh?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> (<i>Blowing his fingers.</i>) It’s roasting hot,
zur.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p><i>Capt. Alder.</i> Send the mess-waiter here, and
then go to your duty, Sir. You are not fit to be
a scullion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Exit John; and as he goes out, three pointer
dogs and a terrier run into the mess-room,
and skurry about; one of them seizes on the
turkey, but finding it too hot for his palate,
drops his prey, and begins to bark loudly at
it. The Mess-waiter and two attendants
arrive in time, and beat out the dogs, after
some difficulty, owing to the canine taste for
gravy.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lieut. Grub.</i> Well, d&mdash; me, if this is not a pretty
<i>mess</i>. I wish I was back with my old corps once
more, in the wilds of Canada. I never saw a
depôt mess yet that could manage a good servant.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Alder.</i> Never! (<i>In a whisper.</i>) Did you
ever know it to manage <i>any thing</i> good?</p>

<p><i>Lieut. Short.</i> Mess-waiter! what follows this
course?</p>

<p><i>Mess-waiter.</i> Rabbits, and the cold beef, Sir.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> The cold beef! The eternal cold beef!</p>

<p><i>Mess-waiter.</i> Gentlemen, I assure you the
market was so bad to-day, that we could only find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
that turkey; but the beef is very sweet and good
yet.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Newly.</i> Mind, that we have no hashed
or deviled turkey this week.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>looking significantly at the dirtied bird.</i>]<br />

then.</p>

<p>[<i>Hash and harrico are now served out amongst
the half-grumbling, half-laughing mess, but
a glass or two of wine restore matters a
little; the rabbits and beef are scarcely

and stale tarts.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ensign Luby.</i> Send round the wine, Mr. President.
I have just touched the cash to-day.
Old dad has sent me a fifty, and I am determined
to be comfortable.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Then I’ll send in your wine account
to-morrow, my lad.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Luby.</i> Ay, do, do&mdash;you’ll not find me
like Mr. Trotter, who marched off yesterday without
waiting for his.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p><i>Several.</i> What! is Trotter off?</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Yes: and in a very ungentlemanly
way too. I knew he couldn’t stand the follies
he gave way to&mdash;out every night until three, and
never sober.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Newly.</i> I think, Mr. President, as I am
a member of the same corps to which Trotter belongs,
you have shown no great proof of taste in
mentioning his name so disrespectfully before
me.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Mr. Newly, I speak of Mr. Trotter
as I think he deserves: he <i>may</i> be very honourable,
but I think he outran his means, and thereby his
honour also.</p>

<p><i>Several voices (in confusion.)</i> Certainly, d&mdash;d
dishonourable conduct.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Luby.</i> Come, lads, hear me: I know
Trotter a little; he is a good young fellow; but
somewhat too free with his cash; he does not know
how to keep it, when he gets it from home. I do
not like to see disputes here,&mdash;God knows we have
enough of them: last night we were all made
unpleasant by two gentlemen contending that one’s
facings were handsomer than the other’s, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
day before we were thrown into confusion by an
argument between two young gentlemen about superior
rank and services&mdash;both not yet two months
in the army. Come, I say&mdash;Trotter owes his
wine-bill: and for the best of reasons&mdash;he had not
money enough left to pay it out of seventy pounds
sent by his father; because, you see, he played
Hell and Tommy (as the phrase goes): so I’ll tell
you what&mdash;I will <i>pay it myself</i>&mdash;ay, or any other
friend’s wine-bill; for, as I said before, I touched
a <i>fifty</i> to-day.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> If I am wrong, Gentlemen, I’ll appeal
to the voice of the company.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> No! no! It’s all right. Sit down&mdash;sit
down.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Luby.</i> Bring in the wine quicker, <i>you</i>
Glundy&mdash;dy’ hear, d&mdash;n ye!</p>

<p><i>Glundy.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>An uproarious laugh from the company,
which sets all the dogs in the house barking,

<p><i>President.</i> Well, tell us how the matter occurred.
Didn’t you knock the watchman down
first?</p>

<p><i>Ensign Buckskin.</i> Not at all. Just hear me:
Jackson and Jones, and Bob Jennings, the young
clergyman&mdash;you know Bob&mdash;great favourite of the
Cathedral big-wigs:&mdash;well, they and I were going
quietly home about three o’clock this morning, a
little merry, and just strolled into the church-yard
to give little Fanny Giggleton a good-night serenade:
her bed-room window, you know, looks into
the church-yard. So we began singing “<i>Rest
thee babe</i>” in full chorus, and finished by roaring
“<i>Jolly companions every one</i>,” when the watchman
came over to us and told us to go home. Jennings
the clergyman was nearest to him, and bade him to
go to the d&mdash;&mdash;l. Charley seized his Reverence,
and his Reverence seized him. I went up to the
old guardian, and warned him off: he took no
notice; so I caught him by the back of his collar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
with my left hand, and by the posterior portion
of his <i>unspeakables</i> with my right: Jennings held
one arm, Jackson another, Jones before us&mdash;so on
we “<i>run</i>” him out of the church-yard and up the
watch-house stairs:&mdash;The watch-house, you know,
is the ancient theatre, and is over the butchers’
shambles. Into it we bundled him&mdash;charged
him before the night Constable with highly disorderly
conduct, in disturbing gentlemen who
were enjoying a song, and also with gross insolence.
The Dogberry, of course, sided with the watchman.
“What’s your name, Sir?” said he to me.
“My name,” said I, “is Old Trumpetson, from
the Cape.” He then began to write it down,
“T. r. u. m. p. son, that’s it,&mdash;Trumpetson,&mdash;now I
have it. Well, Mr. Trumpetson, you are one of the
officers of the garrison; I know where to find you in
the morning; and you Mr. Jenkins also.” My cane
now happened to drop, and I took the candle off
the table to look for it. The Constable stooped
down also beside me&mdash;his red nose looked so
tempting that I could not resist the joke&mdash;I bobbed
the candle into his face; the light went out, and
he roared lustily. All was now confusion: I seized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
a lantern and rattle&mdash;Jackson, Jones, and Jenkins
ran down stairs&mdash;I after them, first locking the
door outside upon the pair within; which I did in
an instant. There we left them, and I suppose
they neither got light nor liberty, until some of
their brethren came to open the door. I know I
shall meet with no mercy from old Muddlehead,
the magistrate: he hates the military&mdash;and me
more than all the rest.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Luby.</i> Did you really burn the fellow’s
nose?</p>

<p><i>Ensign Buckskin.</i> Burn?&mdash;ay, that you may
depend upon.</p>

<p><i>Lieut. Short.</i> I saw him to-day in the barrack
looking for the Commandant&mdash;his nose was in a
small calico bag. [<i>a laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ensign Buckskin.</i> Well, they may all go to
the d&mdash;&mdash;l in a bunch. I’ll pay the fellow for his
nose.</p>

affair.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Buckskin.</i> You must be a clever fellow,
as well as a very presuming one, to fix the donkey-saddle
on us. Who told you that <i>we</i> did it?</p>

<p><i>Ensign Simple.</i> I know it was some of you, if
not all.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Buckskin.</i> Come, ask the gentleman
himself who tied him in the bed; he knows more
about it than you do, a great jackass as he is.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Luby.</i> (<i>to the Donkey.</i>) Who tied you,
Sir?&mdash;hic&mdash;eh?&mdash;He won’t answer.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Simple.</i> I see you are all leagued against
me, because I don’t squander my money amongst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
you; but I’ll have satisfaction&mdash;that I’m resolved
on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>Ensign Luby, inattentive to the last observation,
mounts the donkey and rides him
round the mess-table, while Buckskin gives a
tremendous view halloo! During the uproar,
the Major-commanding enters with his
servant, frothing at the mouth with passion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Major.</i> Turn that donkey out directly. What
<i>can</i> all this mean? Mr. Short, I am surprised
that <i>you</i>, who have been a member of a <i>regimental</i>
mess, should join in such disgraceful proceedings.
Who brought this animal here?</p>

<p><i>Several Voices.</i> Mr. Simple.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Then, Mr. Simple, go to your room.
Consider yourself in arrest.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Simple.</i> I am not to blame, Major.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> Go to your room, Sir. I’ll not hear a
word to-night; your conduct is disgraceful.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Simple.</i> I am not the person.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> You brought the ass into the mess-room,
Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ensign Simple.</i> I found him in my bed, Sir,
and covered with my bed-clothes: it is impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
that I can sleep in my room to-night, from the
horrid state in which the animal has left it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>The Major’s ire could not bear up against
this; he struggled against an involuntary
laugh, and had nearly overcome it, when a
certain motion of the animal, and a grotesque
elevation of his tail put an end to all his
efforts to be severe; so he gave way to a
hearty fit of laughter, in which all but Simple
joined.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Major.</i> Take the cursed brute away, you Sir.</p>

<p class="author">
(<i>Pat the servant pulls the Donkey out of the room.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> He’s a horrid headsthrong baste as ever
I pult.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>Exeunt Pat and Donkey, followed by the
mess-waiter.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Major.</i> I see how it is, Mr. Simple; there has
been a trick played off at your expense. I am
very sorry that folly should lead officers to such
excesses, but I fear we can never remedy the evil.
I am an old officer, gentlemen&mdash;I have been thirty
years in the service, and as long as I can remember
a depot-mess, it has been the same&mdash;all disjointed&mdash;one
scene of disagreement constantly presents
itself. A number of mere boys meet together,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
unacquainted wholly with the rules and habits of
a regiment,&mdash;uncontrolled by the friendly opinions
and directions of their own superior officers, and
they give way to every species of folly. I do believe
that the practice of sending Ensigns to depots is
most injurious to the service. A youth is sent
from school to a depot, where there is not perhaps
one officer of his own regiment: little or no attention
is paid to his conduct; he is neither advised
nor restrained, at a time when he most requires
it; and the consequences are, that every folly,
if not vice, assails him, and he joins his regiment
with an impression which even that excellent
school finds difficult to remove&mdash;his health impaired,
and his pocket exhausted. Gentlemen, I
am giving you a friend’s opinion, and hope every
one of you will use your exertions to check the
follies which prevail but too much at this depot:
and let me also assure you that the sooner you
all join your respective regiments the better&mdash;each
of you can use your private exertions to that
effect, and I will use mine.</p>

<p>After four years of indefatigable exertions&mdash;doubt
and disaster&mdash;success and glory&mdash;sickness
and privation&mdash;hope and delight&mdash;the British army
began to prepare for the promising campaign of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
1813, under a chief whose military talents had
riveted the confidence alike of his soldiers, as
the citizens of that empire, for whose weal&mdash;for
whose glory&mdash;for whose existence as a mistress
of the world, he had shared in all the privations
and sufferings of his troops, and was ready still
to endure even to death, or crown his country’s
hopes with success in that mighty and awful strife
which engaged her so long. The winter had passed,
and the early spring of Portugal had brought to
that country reinforcements, money, and equipments,
the want of which had but too frequently
impeded the success of our army in the Peninsula.
Transports were continually floating up the sunny
Tagus, with their red-cross flags waving from the
masts&mdash;their decks covered with glittering accoutrements,
and hearty soldiers: fresh detachments
and fresh regiments were daily filing off the public
squares of Lisbon, to join the grand army;
while the eyes of the often disappointed Portuguese
followed them with patriotic hope, and their
hearts and tongues ejaculated wishes for their
success. The road from Lisbon to Coimbra and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Vizeu, which had so often withered under the
wasteful tread of war, now glistened with groups
of laughing soldiers and brightening prospects;
even the ruined towns of Condexia and Pumbal
lost their appearance of despair, and assumed a
faint aspect of hope&mdash;such as the dying feel from
leech’s promises. The inhabitants everywhere
were kind, the season was propitious, and the soldiery
seemed to have caught a spirit of confidence
which reacted on the people; and if it did not entirely
remove their doubts and fears, it tended considerably
to advance their hopes of success, and to
tranquillize their long-disturbed minds. The arrival
of the Hussar brigade at Lisbon affected
the Portuguese more than any of the other warlike
preparations&mdash;it was a cordial to their feeble
spirits. This brigade consisted of the 10th, 15th,
and 18th Hussars; and certainly its appearance
was sufficient to encourage them highly;&mdash;the
genius of romantic chivalry never imagined a
more warlike and beautiful body of horse&mdash;their
perfect discipline&mdash;their splendid equipments&mdash;their
health and spirits&mdash;the true British halo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
which seemed to glisten around them&mdash;all conspired
to elevate the Lisbonians almost to a certainty
of success in the approaching campaign.</p>

<p>At no period of the war was there more cause
for strong hope in the Portuguese than at this
time: all the fortresses in their frontier-towns
were in our possession&mdash;those provinces of Spain
which were the favourites of Soult’s army evacuated&mdash;Souchet
just defeated by Sir John Murray
in the South&mdash;and Buonaparte ably opposed
by the Russians; but the Portuguese had been
so often led astray by flattering prospects, that
nothing short of entire success could wholly convince
them that they were secure from the persecutions
of the French.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April I found myself at Oporto,
having marched from Coimbra for the purpose of
joining the left, or third column of the army, under
the command of Sir Thomas Graham; which
was destined to enter Spain by <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tras os Montes</i>.
This column consisted of the first, third, and fifth
divisions, together with the first cavalry division.
The second, or centre column, was under the immediate
command of his Grace the Duke of Wellington;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
and consisted, I believe, of the fourth,
sixth, seventh, and light divisions: this was to advance
to Salamanca. The first, or right column of
the army, under the command of Lord Hill, was
to proceed along the Tagus toward Toledo. Thus
all the forces under the command of the Duke
of Wellington were divided into three powerful
columns; and so disposed as to be available at
several points of attack.&mdash;A finer army&mdash;better
officered and better equipped, from the massy
ponton to the tent peg, never took the field;
and none ever acquitted themselves there more
creditably.</p>

<p>In sketching what I remember of this memorable
campaign, it cannot be expected that I should
display the pen of the historian; if I did so, I
must of necessity draw from other sources than
my own observation and the narratives of my brother-soldiers:
but to this I do not pretend; what
I <i>recollect to have witnessed</i>, or have been told by
eye-witnesses, is all I offer to my readers:&mdash;an
individual on a campaign, as a narrator of what
occurred before him, ought not&mdash;could not consistently,
do more: this I will attempt, so far as I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
conceive the matter may be interesting; I will describe
my humble share in the glories of the army,
and note those things only which, in my progress
with it, appeared to me not unworthy of remark:
I will do so with truth; and if I omit occasionally
the notice of some particulars of interest, familiar
to the memory of some who served with me, it can
only be from want of more acute recollection.
I have no doubt forgotten many a town, and
wood, and valley, and blue mountain, which lay
on my way, and many a circumstance also; however,
enough remains to afford my mind a vivid
picture of that eventful march,&mdash;to me, highly
interesting and delightful, notwithstanding the fatigues
which frequently attended it; and I trust
that what I do remember of it will not be uninteresting
to my readers.</p>

<p>I will mention an incident which happened to
me when I arrived at Oporto; and the motive I
have in touching on so trifling an occurrence is,
that an opinion as to the French influence in Portugal,
even at that promising time, may be in some
measure drawn from it. I arrived at Oporto
about five o’clock in the evening, and received a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
billet upon a respectable house for myself, my servant,
and two horses. The master of this house
was a rich lawyer; and although I learnt that
quarters were very indifferent in the town, yet
the appearance of the house inspired me with
the hope that I should be enabled to make a
better report on this subject, as far as regarded
myself.</p>

<p>The outward gates of the house were open, and
I walked up a wide staircase: having knocked
at a large door, I was admitted by a cross-looking
woman, who in answer to my question of whether
the gentleman of the house was at home, replied,
with a shrug of the shoulders, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Nao esta in caza</i>”
(not within). I explained the nature of my visit,
producing the paper which authorised it; and immediately
the countenance of the dame wore the
most vinegar aspect: “<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Nao esta quartelia, Senhor,
nada, nada, nada</i>” (no room, none, none.) This
I knew must be false, from the size of the house,
as well as from my knowledge of the disposition of
many of the Portuguese to shift off the trouble of
accommodating English officers. However, I was
determined to act only through the authorities; for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the Commander of the forces was very scrupulous
upon this point, and justly so; for many officers
during former campaigns had acted rather despotically
in their quarters, and occasioned reports
of such a nature as to call forth a general order
upon the subject, the effects of which were sorely
felt by those officers whose conduct was peaceable
and conciliating. Consistent with the spirit of
this order, I left the old Donna, telling my servant
he was to remain, and returned to the Portuguese
authorities, who gave me the billet. On describing
my reception, one of them burst out into exclamations
of rage, declaring that the person on
whom I was billeted was a liar and a favourer of
the French. “He had room enough in his house
for <i>four</i> French officers,” said he; “and if he does
not find accommodation for you, Sir, in every way
befitting a British officer, I will send him a dozen of
Portuguese soldiers.” He then wrote a note to the
lawyer, and requested me to take no excuse from
him, but to order my servant to carry my luggage
at once into the house. I pursued the directions
given,&mdash;ordered my boy to unload and place
my panniers, &amp;c. in the house, and proceeded up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
stairs myself. The door was opened, and without
ceremony I walked into the principal room of the
house, where I discovered the lawyer in a fever of
anxiety. He was a little smoke-dried man, of about
fifty years of age, dressed in a spotted <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">robe de chambre</i>,
and powdered in the highest style of professional
ultraism. His fever increased to a paroxysm
when he saw me in the heart of the garrison, for
he never expected such a surprise; he reiterated
the words of the old woman with a grin, (which he
thought was a smile)&mdash;an attempt at polite denial&mdash;a
widening of the mouth into a sort of imitation-smile,
in which his little eyes took no part;
in them could be seen the splenetic rage which
would have burnt me into a cinder, if it had possessed
the power. He declared that he could not
accommodate me, nor any other officer; and had
I been weak enough to parley with him civilly
on the subject, his presumption would have increased
more rapidly than it did; but I coolly
threw myself down upon his splendid sofa, and
desired him to read the note which I brought
from the magistrates. He read it, and after a
pause and a protracted shrug of the shoulders,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
muttered something of the great inconvenience he
should be put to by having an officer billeted on
him; but that he supposed he must put up with
it; and begged that I would walk down to a room
which he had below. I followed him; and after a
tedious hour’s search for keys, he succeeded in
opening an apartment, into which I followed him.
Here, he said, he would put a bed on the floor,&mdash;the
only bed he had; and that he would also send
down two chairs and a table; hinting, at the same
time, that Lord Wellington’s orders were that no
other furniture was in any case to be supplied,
except by the voluntary act of those on whom
officers were quartered. An adequate idea of the
apartment it is scarcely possible to give: it had
been a sort of lumber-room, I suppose, for some
centuries back&mdash;covered with cobwebs&mdash;damp,
dirty, and dark&mdash;not an atom of any kind of
moveable;&mdash;on the ground floor, too! and, contrasted
with the superior accommodation given to
officers by the Portuguese generally, it had the
effect of exciting my indignation against the little
lawyer to such a degree, that had it not been for
the respect I bore for the orders of Lord Wellington,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
I believe I should have punished the insolent
old rogue on the spot, by the application of my
whip to his parchment skin. I paused a little;
then took the key out of the door; and, nodding
ironically to my <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">patrao</i>, I said, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">esta bon</i>”&mdash;“it
will do very well.” I then went out, and ordered
my servant to lead in both the horses:&mdash;there was
scarcely a stable to be got in Oporto for love or
money; and the thought struck me, that I could
not only provide myself with a tolerable substitute
for such accommodation, but punish the little
hater of the English as he deserved.</p>

<p>The horses were brought into the apartment
forthwith, to the astonishment, confusion, and intense
mortification of the lawyer. Neither my
servant nor myself could refrain from laughter at
the picture. The little gentleman’s hands clasped
in the fervency of his raging astonishment; his
frame trembling with passion,&mdash;the old dame exclaiming
loudly at the door, “Ai! Jesus, Maria,
Joze!” and the animals (as all horses will after a
journey,) relieving themselves by those actions,
which in a parlour may seem out of place and
highly laughable, but in a stable “quite correct.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
The scene can only be imagined perfectly by those
who saw it. The lawyer now lost all patience,
and gave way to the most violent and unbounded
rage. He called me “heretic Englishman,” and
openly proclaimed his hatred of Great Britain
and love of France; he stamped, raved, and
ejaculated; but I coolly told him to walk out,
or that I would lock him in with the horses,
as I could not remain longer in my <i>stable</i>.
He obeyed with a scowl and a curse; while I
thanked him in the most <i>polite</i> manner for the
accommodation his house had afforded me, and
went back to the magistrates, to whom I related
the affair. Their enjoyment of the joke was little
less than mine; they advised me to keep the room
as a stable while I remained at Oporto (which I
did), and gave me another billet for myself, upon
a house opposite to the lawyer’s, where I received
the most hospitable attention for the few days I
remained in the town; and had the pleasure of
nodding at old <i>parchment</i> every morning as he
went out of his house; which <i>civility</i> he never
thought proper to notice, except by a frown, peculiar
to his Jacobinical countenance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>As nearly as I can recollect, it was on the
twenty-third of May, that our column commenced
its march from its cantonments. Illness, brought
on by overheating myself in an excursion of pleasure
up the Douro, prevented me from marching
on the appointed day. By the desire of the medical
officer, I remained behind&mdash;having been bled
but more than one day I would not stay, and
although still unwell, persisted in my intention of
moving, and mounted for the road.</p>

<p>The weather was very hot when I set out; and
having been advised by the surgeon not to fatigue
myself, if possible, on the march, until I had perfectly
recovered, I pursued my route at one day’s
march behind the army, without attempting to
gain on it; but had I been in perfect health, I
could not have overtaken it, for my baggage horse
could not have travelled more than about fifteen
or twenty miles a day&mdash;the average distance of
each march of the army; and this is quite enough,
considering the wretched roads over which the animals
had to go, together with the great heat of
the climate.</p>

<p>I proceeded in the track of the army, by <i>Amarante</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
<i>Villa Real</i>, <i>Mirandella</i>, and <i>Oitero</i> the frontier
town, without beholding a military uniform,
and just as if I had been travelling for amusement.
The inhabitants of the considerable towns were
hospitable and cheerful: from all of those to whom
I spoke, I heard the highest encomiums on the army
which had but the day before delighted them with
its grand appearance. The villages in the province
of <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Tras os Montes</i> presented but little of the power
or of the will to afford hospitality to the stranger;
many of the houses were shut up and deserted,
while those which were inhabited were stripped of
almost every accommodation. This arose from the
fear which the poor of that province entertained of
a passing army, whether friends or foes&mdash;they had
retired on the approach of ours, as they were
often in the habit of doing from the French, and
had not returned when I passed. As a proof of
the feelings they entertained for the safety of their
provisions, &amp;c., I will mention a circumstance in
which I was concerned. I had taken possession of
a cottage, in a miserable village, between Villa Real
and Mirandella; it was inhabited by an old woman,
her married daughter, and two little boys:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
they received me with great civility. I, as usual
on the march, enquired whether any sort of provisions
in the village could be purchased; and was
told that I could not&mdash;all was gone&mdash;they had
been destroyed by the French. I asked if I could
not find a fowl, or a few eggs? No, all was gone;&mdash;“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">nada,
nada, nada</i>.” I therefore ordered my
servant to prepare some chocolate and cold beef, on
which I was about to sit down to dine, when I heard
a cock crow as if under ground;&mdash;the countenances
of my hostess and her daughter changed. “Very
odd!” thought I:&mdash;the cock crowed again:&mdash;the
greatest confusion was evident in the old woman’s
face&mdash;she bustled about&mdash;threw down a stool&mdash;slapped
the door, and made every kind of noise
possible; but the cock crowed a third time; when
my servant, who was a droll Portuguese, without
further ceremony addressed the old woman, pointing
at the same time to a huge old chest which
stood on one side of the room, “<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">La esta o gallo,
Senhora</i>,” (there is the cock) said he; and then
removed a small chest from the top of the large one&mdash;opened
the lid; when out flew the tell-tale bird,
followed by seven of his hens, delighted, no doubt,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
as much with his release as their mistress was mortified.
I, however, relieved the old lady’s embarrassment,
by putting a couple of <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">crucadas novas</i>
(about four and sixpence) upon the table: the
sight of the money settled the business, and she,
without hesitation, gave me two of her prisoners&mdash;fine
fat hens&mdash;assuring me that she had lost many
by the soldiers; and fearing another loss from me,
she had determined to pack up her poultry in the
chest: many had bought fowls from her before, but
forgot to pay for them. I passed a pleasant evening
and night at this poor cottage, and the whole
family gave us a loud “<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Viva os Inglezas!</i>” at parting
next morning.</p>

<p>The country through which I passed was highly
picturesque&mdash;it was beautiful to look at, but most
tiresome to travel over: in general the roads are
more like craggy beds of rivers than passages constructed
for communication and the benefits of commerce.
I remember that the very morning I left
the old woman’s cot, it was no more than eight
o’clock when I came in sight of the town at which
I was to halt. I was on the top of a mountain:
beneath me was a river, winding through a fertile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
valley, on the opposite side of which stood another
mountain, apparently not a mile from me; and at
the base of the latter was the town, the bells of
which I could hear ringing; yet it was five o’clock
in the afternoon before I entered it, although I never
halted&mdash;so intricate and difficult was the winding
and steep road I had to pass over. Having mentioned
this, I am reminded of a circumstance that
occurred as soon as I entered the town, which gave
a melancholy proof of the besotted slavery in which
the minds of the Portuguese peasantry are held by
their clergy. An alarm had been given; the bells
were all set in furious motion; every body was
running through the streets towards one place. I
left my servant with the horses, and proceeded
along with the scattered crowd. Every face was
woe-begone&mdash;as though some dire calamity, such as
fire or earthquake, had occurred. The numbers of
the people increased as I advanced. We arrived at
the principal church: I pushed my way into it,
and there the most piteous lamentations assailed
my ears. The church was filled with people&mdash;all
on their knees; tears were streaming down the
old people’s cheeks, and the crowd beating their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
breasts in sorrow. The cause of this mourning
was <i>not</i> an earthquake, though it <i>was</i> a conflagration.
However, it was neither the church nor the
priest that was burnt; but the doll-dressed figure
of the Virgin Mary, which had caught fire from
the carelessness of the church-clerk, in allowing a
lighted candle that he held to touch her holy petticoat!&mdash;the
satin had blazed; but the flames were
soon extinguished, and the damage done was happily
confined to the melting of one of her ladyship’s
wax fingers, scorching her left cheek, discolouring
several tinsel ornaments, and seriously injuring
the outer-petticoat. For this the town was thrown
into confusion, and the streams of its grief let
forth! What crowned the farce, was a young,
ignorant-looking priest haranguing the mob upon
the calamity; pointing with apparent intensity of
sorrow at the burnt hand; kissing it and imploring
his dupes to join him in his grief; no doubt with
a view that they should join him afterwards in
raising funds for <i>re-dressing</i> the Virgin. Such is
the deplorable ignorance of the people of a fine
country! Yet there is a strong party in Europe,
who seek to shut out from them the glorious rays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
of a liberal constitution, and therefore every chance
of enlightenment! But, thank Heaven! there are
others who will spread the light amongst them:&mdash;the
torch of British Liberty now burns over their
heads; and they keep their eyes on it, in spite of
the “holy” and hateful fogs that are ever rising
around them.</p>

<p>I entered Spain from Oitero. In crossing from
the one country to the other a thin wood intervenes,
and for six or seven miles through it, neither
house nor hut is to be seen: it is level ground,
and covered with brush-wood. A few goats and
their herdsman were all the living things I saw
while crossing it: not a bird flew over me.</p>

<p>At the first village which I entered in Spain, I
met with some British soldiers (detached) with a
commissariat officer, who informed me that the
centre column of the main army had entered Salamanca,
headed by Lord Wellington, and that
the French were retreating everywhere, without
making any opposition. Next day I pushed on in
hopes of overtaking the troops belonging to my
division, and now the country forming a fine level,
I was enabled to increase my speed. At length I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
could descry the wide and sweeping track of the
advancing armies&mdash;in the abstract, melancholy to
contemplate! The country was chiefly covered
with a luxuriant crop of corn, over which the immense
column of the army passed, with its baggage,
artillery, and cattle:&mdash;the traces of the cavalry&mdash;of
the infantry&mdash;and of the cannon, could
be distinctly and plainly distinguished from each
other; and although their road was through the
high and firm corn, the pressure upon it was so
great that nothing but clay could be seen, except
at the verges of the tracks, where the broken and
trampled wheat was less over-trodden. Then there
was as much cut down for forage as destroyed by
feet; the mark of the rough sickle of the commissaries,
the dragoons, and the muleteers, were
in patches all around, disfiguring the beautiful
waving ocean of yellowing corn&mdash;<i>ocean</i> indeed&mdash;nothing
can give so just an idea of its expansion:
the corn in that country, does not grow in
fields enclosed like our English, but over the
whole face of the land, making one wide plain
of vegetation, sprinkled at various distances with
little villages, which look like heaps of red tiles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
to the distant eye of the observer: I have counted
not less than twenty-two villages within one
circular view. Such was the country, nearly all
the way to Palencia.</p>

<p>On the third day after I entered Spain, I overtook
the rear of the column&mdash;I think it was the
fourth division&mdash;and continued to march with it.
Here I had an opportunity of seeing the Portuguese
troops in a large body; and they afforded
me subject for delightful reflection. I could not
help thinking what different beings they appeared,
and under what different circumstances they were
placed, from their state and prospects about three
years before, when I first saw them in the field, a
short time after the battle of Busaco: <i>then</i> a more
wretched-looking set of creatures never were beheld&mdash;the
predatory Arabs were not worse clothed,
worse disciplined, or worse fed; there was neither
uniformity in dress, nor equipment for comfort&mdash;threatened
by a rapacious enemy, then in the
heart of their hapless country&mdash;harassed by partial
defeat&mdash;their only hope resting on their handful
of gallant defenders, the British soldiers:&mdash;how
different did they appear <i>now</i>!&mdash;orderly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
cheerful, healthy, well disciplined, well armed; their
polished accoutrements glistening in the sun; their
utensils for comfort all neatly packed upon their
backs; tents on their mules; provisions with their
commissary: not shut up in a niche of their plundered
country, menaced and insulted, but proudly
marching towards the heart of Spain&mdash;of France (as
it turned out)&mdash;their hated invaders in their turn
flying before their regenerated ranks; the British
by their side, and leading them on after the bloody
and successful struggles of three years. Oh! it
was a sight that could not be seen and reflected
upon, without a bounding of the heart! And their
cheers, as their clean blue columns passed through
the Spanish towns, spoke to the slave’s breast, a
magic tongue. Proud indeed may those feel, whose
indefatigable exertions brought the soldiers of
Portugal to the pitch of perfection in which they
then were, and grateful may be that nation to protecting
England for those mighty services. “Liberty!”
was the cry through the ranks, and “Liberty!”
was the cry from the crowd, as they passed
through the towns of Portugal and Spain. Their
songs were embued with their sentiments of patriotism;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
and they sung them often as they went:
their musicians cheered and nourished this feeling,
and their national air “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vencer ou morir</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> as
sung by a number of them, when they encamped
on the frontier of France, with the French in their
front, preparing for battle, was, from its patriotic
sentiments and martial yet melancholy music, one
of the most soul-stirring anthems that ever flowed
from the patriot’s heart:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Portogallo</span>, the
composer of it, may fairly claim a portion of the
laurels which were gained by his countrymen in
every action fought after it became popular. I
have heard it boldly played in the teeth of the
enemy by the Portuguese bands; and I marked
the countenances of the listeners with delight:
it made all Portuguese hearts pant for the fight,
and swell with revenge for the injuries of their
trampled country; and as the voices joined the
music, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vencer ou morir</i>” was not sung without
<i>meaning</i>.</p>

<p>I have written English words to the air, and
perhaps they may not be unacceptable here:&mdash;

<p>The power of music combined with poetry,
seems more gigantic when applied to the struggles
of a people for liberty&mdash;or in other words&mdash;to exalt
the passion of patriotism, than any other emotion
of the heart; perhaps, because the passion <i>itself</i>
is more susceptible of excitement than others. The
songs of every nation speak more strongly the
character of the particular people to which they
belong, than any thing that can be written by the
pen of the commentator or the historian. It was
a great statesman who said “Give me but the
power to write the songs of a nation, and I will
govern them;” an observation in my mind, of no
less strength than truth. The war-songs of every
people are part of their arsenal; and by no means
the least in power. The Scotch pipes have done
nearly as much as the claymore. An instance of
this occurred with the late gallant Colonel Cameron
of the 42d. The piper was detached from
the corps by the order of the General at an engagement
in Holland&mdash;the men went into action
without him;&mdash;they charged, and were repulsed.
The General, on the evening of the same day, said
to the Colonel, “Don’t boast of your 42d again.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
To this censure Colonel Cameron replied, “General,
<i>you</i> are to blame&mdash;you took our arms from
us.”&mdash;“How?”&mdash;“You took the pipes from
us: let us have <i>them</i>, and we’ll prove the 42d
worthy of the highest boast.” This was done; the
regiment had an opportunity next day of charging
with the pipes behind them, and they covered
themselves with glory. The Irish too, at the
storming of Badajos, carried the breach to the
tune of “<i>Garryowen</i>,” played by their own band
under the most destructive fire. The power of
national song was so feared by Buonaparte, that
he forbade the Swiss air “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Ranz des Vaches</i>” in
his army, lest the natives of that country should
desert. It was stated in the French National Assembly
that the Marseillois Hymn brought a
million of recruits to the army; and certainly
it might be said that Dibdin’s songs did more for
the British navy than the whole of the <i>press</i>-gang.
The anthem of “<i>God save the King</i>”
every body values, yet none have said, (although
I believe it to be truth) that it is a strong bulwark
of the throne&mdash;that it throws a sublimity&mdash;a
grandeur&mdash;a general respect around royalty;
excites the warmest sentiments of devotion, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
secures unconscious attachment. The national
hymn of Portugal is strongly expressive of that
mixture of melancholy and martial boldness of
sound which inspires the hearer to meditate revenge
for injuries done; and, as the Spaniards
suffered in a similar way to the Portuguese, <i>their</i>
national song carries with it a sentiment precisely
similar to that of Portugal. This song was not
composed during the days of Ferdinand, but while
the nation was struggling, in concert with the British,
for liberty; and every Guerilla sung it&mdash;every
peasant sung it&mdash;every child sung it. Its
title is, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">A la Guerra Espaniolas</i>;” the Spanish
words of it are simple, but strong; and the music,
like the national air of the Portuguese, is truly
beautiful. The following are English words, written
for it among the mountains of Biscay; and to
those of my readers who know the air, perhaps
they will be acceptable.</p>

&mdash;But enough of music: let us now march on
without it.</p>

<p>I proceeded with the fourth division, and arrived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
after two marches, at the high banks of the
Esla: there it was that I beheld the concentrated
army&mdash;at least the greatest part of it. Some of
the troops had passed the river and “opened the
ball” with the enemy on the opposite bank: their
rear guard had a brisk engagement with our advanced
cavalry, and the 10th Hussars had the
honour to draw the first blood of the campaign&mdash;they
“<i>astonished</i>” the French Dragoons not a
little. After this brush the enemy continued their
retreat rapidly, in the direction of Burgos.</p>

<p>The crossing of the Esla by the army, as I
beheld it, was one of the most impressive, magnificent,
and beautiful sights that was ever presented:
I will describe it briefly, from my memory,
upon which it is indelibly delineated.</p>

<p>The river Esla, at the point where the army
crossed, is in breadth equal to the Thames at
Richmond or Windsor; high banks&mdash;or rather
hills&mdash;rise abruptly on either side, for the most
part covered with short trees and underwood: the
approaches to the river are by even pathways
winding down each side of it. When standing
on that bank where first I saw the river, the water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
appeared to be about three hundred yards below
me, and its course bending so as to exclude a
farther view of it than the segment of a circle of
about a mile in length. On my left, where the
river began to appear, and where the hill on which
I stood pushed itself forward and terminated
in an overhanging rock, the ponton was placed&mdash;immense
boats at regular distances, and well
planked, so as to form a passage of about twenty
feet in breadth, railed on each side compactly:
so admirable a bridge it was, that one would suppose
it to have been a permanent rather than a
temporary erection, which could be at a moment
removed and carried wherever the army went.
Over this passed the troops, with the exception of
some cavalry who forded at another part, and five
of whom (Germans) were swept away by the current
in crossing. An idea may be formed of the
vast quantity of soldiers, muleteers, women, horses,
mules, artillery stores, equipage, and baggage,
which covered the hills near the ponton, when I
say, that I was from ten o’clock in the morning
until five in the afternoon, before it came to my
turn to pass the water; and all this time the bridge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
was filled with columns of men. We who waited
for our turn, sat on the hill under the trees, eating
cold beef and biscuit, chatting, and admiring the
splendid scene. The day was as bright as the sun;
a general hilarity spread over every countenance;
the Spanish and Portuguese muleteers cracked their
loud jokes with the soldiers&mdash;laughed and sung&mdash;ate
their rations, and toasted their friends in grog.
To add still more interest to the scene, many
elegant English ladies&mdash;wives of the officers&mdash;were
to be seen upon the rock which overhung the
river, with their gay parasols and waving feathers,
while immediately below was the bridge with its
moving mass&mdash;horse&mdash;foot&mdash;artillery&mdash;baggage&mdash;and
followers:&mdash;a little above this, and still beneath
the ladies, were groups of bullocks swimming
across the river, and with difficulty gaining
the opposite bank, owing to the power of the
current; while others were climbing the opposite
hills, refreshed and relieved from the dust of their
day’s travel, by the cool water from which they
had just emerged. The distant and lessening line
of troops as it winded upwards to the plain above,
and broke into several divisions to take up ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
for the night, added an admirable perspective
background to the picture. Then arose the hum
of the crowd&mdash;the loud command&mdash;the laugh&mdash;the
mingling of different languages&mdash;the lowing
of oxen&mdash;the neighing of horses, and the braying
of the less noble animals&mdash;the clear sky&mdash;the
bright sun&mdash;the crystal river, overhung and darkened
in the distance by bold rocks, on which the
wondering goatherd lay as his goats carelessly
browsed&mdash;it was a scene never to be forgotten.
Every soldier saw at a glance the collective
strength of the great military machine of which
he formed a part&mdash;all beneath his eye, as it were
in a theatre: this heightened the glow of pride
within him, and elevated his spirit with the buoyancy
of glorious hope&mdash;all was cheerfulness, and
the army looked more like conquerors, than men
about to enter into a bloody and doubtful contest.
I spent seven hours in admiring, and then crossed
in my turn the ponton; took up my quarters for
the night, with my horses, under a shed; and slept
as soundly as the Prince who was cast into a seven
years’ sleep by a fairy.</p>

<p>The morning was only opening her eyes, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
the drum beat and we turned out: the fires of
the night were expiring; around many of which
groups of soldiers were assembled, packing up
their knapsacks and fixing their accoutrements.
The moving to and fro of military figures, all over
the level ground, before me&mdash;the tingling of the
mules’ bells&mdash;the drums at various distances&mdash;the
early birds chirping&mdash;the horses champing their
barley&mdash;the men biting their biscuit&mdash;the increasing
hum and the coming daylight&mdash;by degrees,
dissipated the heaviness which naturally
succeeded to a short <i>field</i> sleep, and the cheerfulness
of the preceding day was restored throughout.&mdash;The
column was in motion; and the field,
where thousands crowded, was, in a few minutes,
as naked and silent as a desert.</p>

<p>At this ground we had expected a desperate
fight; but with the exception of a brush with our
Hussars, the enemy showed no wish to trouble us.
The soldiers now became still more elevated with a
confidence in success; and the wishful cry which
every where along the march had resounded in
their ears, from the inhabitants, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vamus a Francia!</i>”&mdash;“(<i>Away
to France!</i>)” was considered as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
about to be realized; yet most of the army expected
that we should first have a desperate struggle
at the Ebro.</p>

<p>We marched by Aguilar to Palencia; our light
cavalry by Zamora and Toro: the right and centre
columns of the army, with Lord Wellington,
passed through Salamanca to Valladolid&mdash;the whole
directing their march to Burgos. At Palencia I
first saw the ponton boats in their carriages: they
were drawn by oxen; each boat had a carriage to
itself, and each carriage was drawn by from twelve
to sixteen. The boats were reversed&mdash;or bottom
uppermost&mdash;and seated on them were the pontoneers,
dressed in naval uniform; these were
men specially employed to launch the boats, form
the bridge, and, in short, to conduct that service
through all its branches. I had but a faint idea
of the extreme ponderosity of warlike machinery
until I beheld these boats upon their carriages:
the battering rams of the Romans were go-carts
compared with the ponton train on the march:
the Spaniards, as they passed, threw up their
eyes in an ecstasy of admiration at the sight of
them, and cheered loudly while they were in view.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Over those boats were to pass to France, which
they feared and hated, the invading and delivering
armies&mdash;over them the cannon that was to
thunder their victory:&mdash;this thought was enough
to make them cheer, and their “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">vivas!</i>” were well
answered by the troops that followed.</p>

<p>I remained at Palencia until the evening of the
day on which the pontons passed through it; and
there I accidentally met with a young officer,
whose subsequent greatness I little thought then
depended so on the success of our campaign, as
it afterwards turned out. This officer was Captain
De Grammont, then of the 10th Hussars,
but now his Grace the Duc de Guiche. He is a
part of the royal family of France, aid-de-camp
to the Duke d’Angoulême, and high in favour at
the Tuilleries. When I saw him at Palencia, he
appeared one of the finest models of a young
Hussar chief I ever beheld: he wore his beard,
which curled upon his chin; his regimentals were
sufficiently field-rubbed to have lost that <i>very</i> bright
gloss which distinguished them on the parade at
home; and there was a melancholy cast about his
countenance and manner, which, from being mixed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
with the most affable address, made a strong impression
upon me&mdash;particularly when I learnt his
true situation. He was engaged against his countrymen&mdash;but
for his country’s rights; and he had
only a day or two before met them in the charge.
It was <i>his</i> troop that spilled the first French blood
of that campaign, and it was <i>his</i> subaltern who
gave the first wound. He described the charge to
me: it was thus:&mdash;The French having crossed the
Esla, a strong guard covered their retreat, and the
10th Hussars attacked their rear, which was defended
by light dragoons. In advancing to the
charge, the Subaltern of Captain De Grammont,
Cornet Fitzgerald&mdash;a lad of only sixteen years of
age&mdash;happened to have been somewhat in advance
of the troop, owing to the mettle of his horse: the
Cornet’s servant rode beside him in the ranks, and
determined to protect his master. The French
dragoons came on gallantly; their swords were
nearly as long again as those of our Hussars; and
a ferocious looking Sergeant was coming at full
gallop&mdash;right in front of the Cornet: in vain was
the young officer called on to pull in his horse&mdash;on
he went, his servant closing up to him in order to
avert the steel of the opponent: a moment more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
and the long straight sword of the French dragoon
would have been cased in the youth’s breast; for the
servant’s horse could not head his master’s. The
Captain expected to see him fall; but just as the
point of the weapon approached, the cornet grasped
his pistol&mdash;fired&mdash;and down the dragoon tumbled
from his saddle! This was but an instant before
the remainder of the hussars were mixed with
their opponents; and in a few minutes more, they
were pursuing them as fugitives, killing, wounding,
and taking many of them. I remembered
having seen this heroic youth at Lisbon, when the
regiment landed there: he was a mere stripling,
with light hair, and rosy cheeks&mdash;anything but
the man destined to kill the first Frenchman on
the campaign; and I still more admired him when
I heard that he was a son of the celebrated Lord
Edward Fitzgerald, and cousin to the present
Duke of Leinster. I met Captain De Grammont
afterwards, at the close of the campaign, and he assured
me joyfully, that he had had the pleasure,
the day before, of looking from the Pyrenees, while
on piquet, at the lawful estates of his family; and
only a very few months after this, I had the gratification
of seeing him enter the town of Bordeaux
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
as a Duke, and on the staff of his lawful
Prince, the Duke d’Angoulême. This officer, although
born in France, is in language and manners
a perfect English gentleman, from having
been since his infancy in England. He received
his commission in the 10th Hussars when very
young, and remained in the regiment until the
restoration of the Bourbons. Should we yet go
to war with France, I should be sorry to see the
gallant soldier arrayed against us, and I am sure
it would be no pleasurable office to himself.</p>

<p>We moved on the left of Burgos, which city the
French, contrary to our expectation, had not shut
up, but quickly abandoned at the approach of the
British. I slept in the house of an intelligent
peasant, about two miles from the fortress, and
of course the war was the subject of our chat. I
found the man very communicative: he had the
fullest hope of our success, and gave it as his
opinion, that the French would <i>not</i> stand at the
Ebro. He talked of the time when the British
were before on his ground; and showed me in his
fields some of their bones&mdash;bleached white and
dry: he informed me that a great number of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
army perished there. This man, from his apparent
acquaintance with the events of the war in
Spain, I have no doubt had taken an active part
in it&mdash;perhaps on the French side; for if it had
been on the other, he most probably would not
have made it a secret in our conversation; however,
many of the Spaniards sided with the
strongest party, and now that the British held the
sway, this peasant was their warmest well-wisher.</p>

<p>We proceeded through Villa Diego towards the
Ebro, and came in sight of that river from the
plain&mdash;or high table land&mdash;over which I had been
travelling ever since I had left Portugal. The
advanced troops had passed the river that morning
without opposition, for the French had continued
their retreat. The view of the valley&mdash;or rather amphitheatre&mdash;at
the bottom of which the Ebro runs,
astonished me by its beauty: for several days I
had been accustomed to little variation of scenery&mdash;all
level country; and now the bosom of luxuriant
and romantic nature suddenly presented itself
to my sight, as if it were done by magic. Half a
dozen steps brought me from a view of mere sky
and corn plains, to a scene of the most splendidly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
varied character&mdash;a deep valley, or rather hollow,
of about ten miles in circumference, surrounded
by woody mountains, except at that part directly
facing me. This part opened, and there the eye
might travel over blue hills, until the more distant
could not be distinguished from the light clouds
of the horizon. In this circular valley, every
variation of rural beauty was to be seen&mdash;cultivated
fields&mdash;luxuriant foliage&mdash;bubbling streams&mdash;winding
paths&mdash;villas, and farm-houses. At the
bottom ran the Ebro,&mdash;in this place a river of no
great breadth; and here the main body of the
liberating army had crossed a few hours before me.</p>

<p>The line of march now lay along a small branch
of a river, which watered the foot of high and bold
rocks, shelved and wooded in the most picturesque
manner; trees, rooted over trees, hung out in grotesque
attitudes, or dipped downwards, as if seeking
the black and clear water beneath&mdash;thick
moss, streaming underwood, wild flowers, and
massy trunks, mingled to beautify the first day’s
march after we crossed the Ebro:&mdash;this repaid me
amply for the toil of the preceding days.</p>

<p>I remained an hour behind the division, to refresh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
my horses&mdash;they having been nearly knocked
up; and it was at this place I perceived the first
effects of fatigue in some of the soldiers. The
army had, for the preceding march, pressed onwards
more rapidly than before, and the weather
had become very hot; several men, therefore,
lagged behind, and I met eight or ten of them
sitting by the side of the river&mdash;some only severely
blistered on the feet from walking, but others
extremely ill. There was no depôt nearer than
Valladolid&mdash;about ninety miles distant; for the
army’s advance was so rapid and so unexpected,
that no time could be allowed for considerations
of this kind; and the soldiers, if left behind, would
have fared but miserably indeed&mdash;particularly those
who were ill there. I, without hesitation, laid an
embargo upon a sort of cart, which was drawn by
two horses, and which happened, fortunately, to be
near; in this vehicle I directed the men to place
themselves and their kits, which they had unbuckled
from their backs, and dispatched them to
continue their march. I also desired the men not
to permit the carter to return until they overtook
their division. “All is fair in war,” says the unamiable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
adage: it was a hard case for the Castilian
carter, but for the poor disabled soldiers it would
have been a still harder; and I thought I could
not do better, under the circumstances, than to
oblige the peasant, who seemed well-fed and hearty,
to do “the state some service,” whether he was so
disposed or not.</p>

<p>Our march was now ten times more a march of
pleasure than it had been before we crossed the
Ebro, although it did not long hold that character:
there was soon something for the army to do besides
to admire the scenery, sing songs, and smoke
cigars. Each day’s march was concluded about
twelve or one o’clock, and the men encamped or
bivouacked usually on some open glade, near or in
a small wood; or perhaps in a valley by a river:
here they unbent from the toils of the morning, and
escaped the meridian heat of the sun, within their
tents, or beneath the thick foliage with which nature
so profusely stocked the country. A considerable
distance right and left of the road, where the army
encamped each day, was changed from the silence
in which it had so long dwelt, to the hum and
bustle of a populated city. The first thing done,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
on arriving at the ground for encampment, was to
cook:&mdash;rations were served out; wood, water, and
fire, made ready: and while the meat was boiling&mdash;or
<i>broiling</i>, more frequently, upon a wooden spit&mdash;the
men would sit together in groups on the grass,
and chat. After dinner, they employed themselves
for a short time in washing both themselves and
their linen in the neighbouring streams&mdash;cleaning
their arms, clothes, &amp;c., and then a pipe and a
cup of grog prepared the way for a sweet and
sound sleep on the turf.</p>

<p>A description of the manner in which I have
seen bullocks slaughtered on the march, may not
be uninteresting. We had our own butchers,&mdash;men
from the ranks; but, in general, the oxen
were slaughtered by Spaniards or Portuguese:
and, in my mind, their mode of depriving a bullock
of life is by far the most expeditious; it certainly
gives little, if any, torture to the animal.
They, having tied a noose about the horns of the
beast, drew the end of it round a tree, and secured
the head close to it; then instantly pushed a sharp-pointed
knife down between the back of the skull
and the first vertebræ of the neck: this was no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
sooner done than the animal was dead: the veins of
the neck were then opened, and the blood flowed.</p>

<p>In the division with which I marched, the Spanish
butcher adopted a singular mode of securing
the bullock destined for slaughter; he had trained
a huge mastiff to be his assistant, and thus they
operated:&mdash;the butcher held his dog by a chain,
and having let loose one of the drove of oxen,
took the chain off the mastiff, and gave him the
word; the dog ran instantly to the bullock; seized
him by the nose in his teeth; and, without the least
noise, held him forcibly down: the butcher then
plunged the knife in, and the animal rolled lifeless.
All this was done in less than half a minute.
The first place at which I witnessed this dog at his
calling, was at Villa Diego; and no sooner were
the veins of the neck opened, than several Spanish
old women, with pans in their hands, squabbled
about catching the blood: the greatest vixen succeeded
in obtaining it; and I learnt that it was to
be used as food for her family. It is said that the
poor of Connaught eat the blood of oxen; if so,
may not the practice have been brought over by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the Spaniards, from whom the inhabitants of that
province claim extraction?</p>

<p>We were now in a mountainous country, and
consequently the army, which had been all united
on the march after crossing the Esla, was obliged
to separate, and move by various roads to one
point. In a day or two we found that the French
were about to give up their running, and try their
fortune by a stand. We were halted on the 20th
of June, about four or five miles from Vittoria,
and our columns closed in from various directions:
we were told by several peasants that the French,
under the command of Joseph Buonaparte and
Marshal Jourdain, were between us and Vittoria;
and when we saw the Duke of Wellington pass
along the road close to us, with several of his generals,
we suspected we should not long lie idle: we
knew his Grace was going to the front to reconnoitre.
I never saw him look better in my life;
the march had improved his health, and success
had brightened his looks in such a manner, that I
fancied he felt confident of beating the enemy in
“off hand” style at the first brush. I observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the several Portuguese battalions pass, as fresh
for work as if they had not marched two miles; and
in several Spanish corps which crossed us to the left
under the command of Colonel Longa, I saw physical
strength, although neither equipment nor high
spirits. Our own troops looked as well as ever they
did&mdash;the sun-browned and laughing faces of Johns,
Pats, and Sawneys, gave assurance that they were
highly disposed to enjoy “a bit of diversion.”</p>

<p>During the 20th the men refreshed themselves
with change of linen, &amp;c. in the best way they
could, and enjoyed the evening of that day as happily
as if they were reposing after a hunting excursion;
every shade had its group, and the country
afforded the most picturesque situations for
bivouacking. My dinner was spread upon a green
spot beneath an overhanging bank, covered with
thick foliage, which shut out the hot sun; a clear
stream rippling beneath; and here six of us enjoyed
an evening’s chat as comfortably as if we
were on the banks of one of the Cumberland
lakes. We expected to be engaged next day, and
the allusions which this expectation brought forth,
although calculated to stir up some thoughts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
home and friends, did not abate that cheerfulness
which the scene present diffused. Our mortal
enemy, old Death, was spoken of occasionally, but
it was with a smile; no more was thought about
him than about Marshal Jourdain or the ex-king
Joe.</p>

<p>The night closed around, and the thousands lay
down to sleep upon the turf; some by large fires,
some beneath the cover of temporary huts, and
some with nothing over them but their blankets,
and the universal coverlid&mdash;beneath which many
were to lie the following night for ever without
waking! The weather was mild and delightful&mdash;the
sky was beautiful, and many eyes were employed
in gazing on it, and picturing over its blue breast
the sweet scenes of home&mdash;the faces of those friends
then far away! That was the hour for thinking;
and I have no doubt it was so spent by thousands
of the soldiers before they sunk into sleep.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st, we commenced our
march early, and in two hours we came to an open
country, on the right of which was a ridge of hills;
about a mile distant on the left, a gradual descent
of even land to a village about two miles off; far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
in the front&mdash;perhaps at three miles’ distance&mdash;were
the spires of Vittoria to be seen rising to our view
as we advanced; while about half a mile in our
front we could spy the Frenchmen’s huts, and
they themselves running to arms as if we had surprised
them:&mdash;indeed this <i>was</i> the case; for their
cooking utensils were on their fires when our advanced
troops trod over their ground. Columns
of French were now to be seen moving about in
the distance, and columns of our own men were
every moment emerging from cover. The Staff
was everywhere to be seen galloping to and fro&mdash;brigades
of artillery and regiments of cavalry
taking up their ground; and in about twenty minutes
a column of Spaniards, led by General Murillo,
moved out from the right of our line&mdash;Hill’s
divisions&mdash;up towards the heights, and commenced
firing upon the enemy stationed there: these hills
are called the heights of La Puebla, and here
rested the enemy’s left. The Spaniards, we could
see, made good their ground on the hills; but reinforcements
of French troops advanced against
them, and Lord Hill ordered out two regiments
of British troops to support the Spaniards, led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
by the Hon. Colonel Cadogan of the 71st. Now
began the fight, and every moment increased it.
The red coats were met by increased numbers of
the blue, and the firing became incessant; the
Spaniards poured in their balls in good style on
the advancing French, who attemped to overwhelm
with numbers their small force; but Lord Hill
detached column after column to the attack: we
could only distinguish the men as a body, but
could not see the individuals; however, the colour
of the coats sufficiently marked out friend from
foe, and the <i>reds</i> were evidently “doing the business.”
The 71st had fired and stood the fire a
considerable time, but could not mount the hill
effectually (as I have heard from an officer then
present): at this time their commander, the Hon.
Colonel Cadogan received a ball in the groin: he
fell, and was immediately surrounded by some of
his men, and lifted up by them in order to be removed
to the rear: the 71st was then about to apply
to their old friend the bayonet&mdash;ready for the
charge: their Colonel lay in the arms of two soldiers,
the balls showering from the hills&mdash;“Stop!
stop!” said he, “don’t take me away until I see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
my men charge!” It was done, and gallantly&mdash;up
hill too: the Colonel cheered as well as his
failing voice would allow, and his last moments
were blessed with the smile of victory. The hills
were very soon taken, and the enemy driven in.</p>

<p>The artillery now thundered from both sides;
and down to the left we could see General Graham’s
wing advancing against a distant village
there. This was the part of the army to which I
belonged; and now, for the first time since the
march began, had an opportunity of gaining my
division. The centre of the army, with which I
then stood, now advanced to cross the Zadora, a
small river&mdash;for Lord Hill <i>had</i> crossed it soon
after he gained the heights; firing was everywhere
along the line, before me and on both sides; the
French stood bravely and poured in their musketry;
their cannon was not a moment silent, unless
stormed and taken by our men. I saw a couple
of field pieces attacked by a regiment of Portuguese,
and they astonished me with their courage
and activity&mdash;they leaped over the guns like madmen,
although blazing in their teeth, and captured
them gallantly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>Having now seen where my station ought to be,
I determined to proceed to it, and without a moment’s
delay galloped to the left, in the rear of the
line, just as the troops crossed the river; and I
arrived at the village attacked by Sir T. Graham
(Gamarra Mayor) just as the bridge was carried.
Three pieces of artillery fortified this bridge; but
notwithstanding this, as well as a powerful force
of infantry for its defence, our troops overcame
all; but not without considerable loss. At this
place, both the Colonels of the 59th (Weare and
Fane) fell, while gallantly leading their men to
the bridge.</p>

<p>It was now about half-past two or three o’clock
in the afternoon, and no artillery but ours was to
be heard; retreating columns and broken crowds
were to be seen at various distances, to the extent
of about half a mile in breadth, while our men
were pursuing. Our dragoons advanced upon
their rear&mdash;the infantry after them; but from the
difficulty of the ground, the cavalry could not
finish so completely as was to be wished, what the
infantry had begun. The artillery followed up,
and cannonaded the flying in their best style;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
and it was clear that victory was our own at every
point.</p>

<p>We marched on to Vittoria without firing a
shot; and on the left of the town I had the pleasure
of seeing the whole baggage, treasure, &amp;c.
of the enemy, in the hands of our troops. It was
now getting late in the evening; the whole army
continued the pursuit; but too much was done
during the day to expect that the troops could
advance much beyond Vittoria; they did, however,
a couple of leagues, when they halted; and thus
the scattered French escaped farther punishment.
I was sent on duty to the town of Vittoria, and
there passed the night.</p>

<p>The scene which presented itself in the town
that evening may be easily imagined:&mdash;prisoners&mdash;wounded&mdash;drunken
Spaniards&mdash;stray horses and
mules running to and fro&mdash;broken carriages&mdash;dead
and dying&mdash;the inhabitants panic-struck&mdash;the
rear of our light dragoons galloping through
the town&mdash;fires in the streets&mdash;drunken plunderers
rolling about&mdash;the groan and the laugh and
the imprecation&mdash;all mingled! Such was Vittoria
after the battle. To increase the confusion, an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
explosion took place, which shook every house
and spread consternation around: none could imagine
the cause. I at first supposed treachery from
the Spaniards, but a moment’s consideration removed
this suspicion. In a short time our Provost
and his assistants informed us of the nature of this
explosion. The 18th Dragoons, and many stragglers
of infantry, had remained to help themselves
to dubloons from a French military chest, which
fell into our hands near the town, and plunder
raged for two or three hours; our soldiers would
not <i>take</i> silver&mdash;nothing but gold would <i>pass</i> with
them; the former they left to the Spaniards, for it
was absolutely a “<i>drug in the market</i>.” About
ten o’clock it became dark, and amongst the crowd
of waggons, many, containing the treasure, might
escape; therefore a number of Spanish peasants,
muleteers, &amp;c. procured candles, and went in
search of farther golden discoveries, in order to
open an <i>opposition mine</i> for themselves, as the
<i>English</i> showed such monopoly in their <i>companies</i>.
In the prosecution of this <i>speculation</i>, one of them
happened to thrust his candle into a powder waggon,
while his coadjutors were surrounding it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
waiting for the <i>report</i> upon its merits; the <i>mine</i>
sprung, and hurled the <i>company</i> into the air:
many were blown to atoms, and those who escaped
immediate death, I saw next day&mdash;they were as
black as Africans, their heads and faces swollen,
and their eyes closed up: poor creatures, they
presented a pitiable sight! very few of them recovered.
Had these men been satisfied with humble
silver, and not have run after <i>mining speculations</i>,
they would have done better; but such folly
is not confined to ignorant peasants&mdash;the great
metropolis of London has furnished us with examples
of far greater avarice and folly in the
pursuit of <i>gold mines</i>.</p>

<p>The only <i>wholesale dealer</i> in the plunder of the
French military chest who essayed his talents at
Vittoria, was a commissariat <i>officer</i>: he very coolly
ordered one of his muleteers to load eight or nine
mules with boxes of dubloons, and dispatched him
with a letter of consignment to Lisbon; where,
had the treasure arrived, the commissary’s fortune
would have been made. But it was otherwise ordained;
for the muleteer, in going back through
Spain, boasted at a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">posado</i> that he had immense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
treasure in his charge. An Alcaldi was present
drinking; and from the circumstances of the mules
being without a military escort, yet admitted to
contain specie, suspicion arose. He continued to
drink with the muleteer, and the latter, in his careless
cups, dropped the letter which the commissary
had given him to deliver to his correspondent at
Lisbon. The Alcaldi withdrew; opened the letter&mdash;and
with the help of the curate of the village,
who knew a little English, discovered that the
treasure was not sent by any authority. In consequence
of this, he seized the whole&mdash;mules,
muleteer, and all. The result was, that the
gold was sent back, and the commissary thought
it right to run away, without waiting for farther
enquiry. Thus ended <i>his</i> speculation: but speculation
at best is <i>only</i> speculation&mdash;except in this
case; for here it lost a <i>letter</i>, and therefore was
clearly&mdash;<i>peculation</i>.</p>

<p>The day after the battle, I, in company with
another, rode out to view the ground where the
armies had so recently contended. It was strewed
with dead and wounded, accoutrements and arms;
a great part of the latter broken. At those points
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
where obstinate fighting took place, the ground
was covered with bodies: a great number of
wounded, both French, English, and Portuguese,
lay along the road, groaning and craving water.
The village of <i>Gamarra Mayor</i> was shattered with
heavy shot, and the bridge covered with dead, as
well as its arches choked up with bodies and accoutrements.
We returned by the main road, to
where the centre of the army was engaged. Here
were the French huts, and their broken provisions,
half cooked, lying about; this was a level interspersed
with little hillocks and brushwood: we
were then surrounded with dead and wounded;
several cars were employed in collecting the latter.
A few straggling peasants could be seen at a distance,
watching an opportunity for plunder&mdash;there
was a dreadful silence over the scene. A poor
Irishwoman ran up to one of the surgeons near
us, and with tears in her eyes, asked where was the
hospital of the 82nd regiment&mdash;I think it was the
82nd&mdash;she wrung her hands, and said that the
men told her she would find her husband wounded;
and she had travelled back for the purpose. The
surgeon told her that the only hospital on the field
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
was in a cottage, to which he pointed; but informed
her that all the wounded would be conveyed
to Vittoria. The half-frantic woman proceeded
towards the cottage, over the bodies which lay in
her way, and had not gone more than about fifty
yards, when she fell on her face, and uttered the
most bitter cries. We hastened to her&mdash;she was
embracing the body of a sergeant, a fine tall fellow,
who lay on his face. “Oh! it’s my husband&mdash;it’s
my husband!” said she; “and he is dead and
cold.” One of the men turned the body on his
face; the sergeant had been shot in the neck, and
his ankle was shattered. The lamentations of the
woman were of the most heart-rending kind, but
not loud. She continued to sit by her lifeless husband,
gazing on his pale countenance, and moving
her head and body to and fro, in the most bitter
agony of woe:&mdash;she talked to the dead in the most
affectionate language&mdash;of her orphans&mdash;of her home&mdash;and
of their former happiness. After a considerable
time, by persuasion, we got her upon one
of the cars with the wounded, and placed the body
of her husband beside her; this we did, because
she expressed a wish to have it buried by a clergyman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
She thanked us more by looks than words,
and the melancholy load proceeded slowly to Vittoria.</p>

<p>In our way back to the town, my companion’s
attention was attracted by a dead Portuguese; he
raised up the body, and asked me to look through
it&mdash;I <i>did</i> absolutely look <i>through</i> it. A cannon-ball
had passed into the breast and out at the
back&mdash;and so rapid must have been its transit,
from its forming such a clear aperture&mdash;in circumference
about twelve inches&mdash;that the man must
have been close to the cannon’s mouth when he
was shot&mdash;it spoke volumes for the courage of the
troops.</p>

<p>The hospital at Vittoria that evening presented
a sad spectacle; not only was part of it filled with
wounded, but the streets all round it&mdash;about two
thousand men, including those of the French with
those of the Allies. Owing to the rapid, and perhaps
unexpected, advance of the army, there were
only three surgeons to attend to this vast number of
wounded, for the first two days after the battle;
and, from the same reason, no provisions were to be
had for them for a week! The Commissariat had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
not provided for the exigency, and the small portion
of bread that could be purchased was sold at
three shillings per pound. From these casualties,
I often thought since, that in cases of expected
general actions, if one half of both medical and
commissariat staff were under orders to remain
on the field until relieved, instead of following
their respective divisions, it would obviate such
privations. However, there is every excuse in this
case, considering the unexpected rapidity of the
advance. No fault whatever can be laid to either
of the departments in this instance: it was wholly
owing to advancing to such distance beyond Vittoria,
as required too long a time to retrace.</p>

<p>In going through the hospital, I saw in one room
not less than thirty Hussars&mdash;of the 10th and 15th,
I think&mdash;all wounded by lances; and one of them
had nineteen wounds in his body:&mdash;the surgeon
had already amputated his left arm. One of the
men described the way in which so many of their
brigade became wounded. He said, that in charging
the rear of the enemy as they were retreating,
the horses had to leap up a bank, nearly breast
high, to make good the level above. At this moment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
a body of Polish Lancers, headed by a
General, dashed in upon them, the General crying
out, in broken English, “<i>Come on! I care not for
your fine Hussar brigade.</i>” They fought for a
considerable time, and although ultimately the
Lancers retired and left the ground to the Hussars,
yet the latter lost many killed and wounded.
“That man,” said the Hussar, “who lies there
with the loss of his arm and so dreadfully wounded,
fought a dozen Lancers, all at him at once,
and settled some of them; at last he fell, and the
Lancers were about to kill him, when the General
cried out to take him to the rear, for he was a
brave fellow. The skirmish continued, and the
General cut that man there across the nose, in
fighting singly with him&mdash;but he killed the General
after all.”</p>

<p>I turned and saw a young Hussar, with a gash
across his nose, and he confirmed what his comrade
said. The man who had the nineteen wounds,
I have since heard, recovered: he seemed much to
regret the fate of the General who saved his life.
I saw this brave officer’s body buried the next
day in the principal church in Vittoria.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>In passing through another part of the hospital,
I perceived a Portuguese female lying on
the ground upon straw, in the midst of numbers
of wounded men. I enquired of her, was she
wounded. She pointed to her breast, and showed
me where the bullet had passed. I asked her
how she received the shot, and was horror-struck
when the dying woman informed me that it was
her <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">marido</i>,&mdash;her own husband,&mdash;who shot her just
as the action was commencing&mdash;she said he deliberately
put the muzzle of his gun to her breast
and fired! This may be false; I hope it is,
for the sake of humanity:&mdash;it might be that the
woman was plundering the dead; and perhaps
killing the wounded, when some of the latter
shot her. However, be the fact as it may, it was
thus she told her story. She was in great pain,
and I should think did not live much longer.</p>

<p>Colonels Weare and Fane, who fell so gloriously,
were buried behind this hospital:&mdash;but I
have dwelt upon this circumstance at another part
of the work.</p>

<p>The people of Vittoria were very far from
enthusiastic in favour of the English, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
they behaved with apparent gratitude; but this
may be accounted for by the yet uncertainty
which prevailed, as to our ultimate power of driving
the French out of Spain. Bull-fights and
balls took place, and the new constitution was read
and honoured; but there was a want of warmth
in the people, quite incompatible with true patriotism:&mdash;on
the whole, it was supposed that
Vittoria was not unfavourable to foreign tyranny.</p>

<p>A few days after the battle, the 6th division of
the army passed through Vittoria, on their march
to join the main body of the army. This division,
from having been often employed on detached
service, acquired the name of the “<i>Flying Invisibles</i>,”
by the rest of the army. They were certainly
not at the battle; but it was not their fault,
for they were left three days’ march in the rear,
to protect the transport of the stores, &amp;c. The
men presented a motley appearance; they had
not received a supply of clothing as had been expected,
and the consequence was that scarcely any
red cloth was to be seen amongst their jackets, so
patched were they with that of every other colour.
Many had no shoes, and altogether they excited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
commiseration; but the men themselves were as
hearty and as healthy as any soldiers in the army.</p>

<p>While I remained at Vittoria, I learned that an
attempt to storm St. Sebastian had been made by
the allied armies, and had failed: it was also
stated that the Spaniards of the fortress were the
most active in defending the breach. Little fighting,
I believe, took place in front, except at Roncesvalles
and the pass of Maya&mdash;the gates of the
French territory; and here, I believe, there was an
effectual attack made by the French against our
troops&mdash;at least so far successful, that the latter
were obliged to retire a little, after having fought
gallantly. A considerable number of men wounded
in this affair were sent back to Vittoria.</p>

<p>I was now ordered to the front, and after a few
days’ marches through a most delightful and tranquil
country, arrived at a village near Pamplona,
called Bastania. Here were quartered two heavy
Dragoon regiments&mdash;all the cavalry, indeed, were
near; for it was a wide open country, and consequently
fit for the operations of Dragoons. In the
centre was the fortified town of Pamplona, within a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
mile of which we durst not approach. The Pyrenees
were about half a mile in front of Bastania,
and the cavalry were placed here in case the enemy
should succeed in forcing their way down to the
plain for the relief of the citadel, in which 1,200
French were shut up:&mdash;had they done so, the horse
could have acted with great effect upon them. This
was in the latter end of July; and I believe the
Duke of Wellington had closed the army in from
the right, and intended to push on with his whole
force to France. The Spaniards he had placed to
invest Pamplona.</p>

<p>I slept at Bastania the night I arrived: there
were not more than a dozen houses in the village,
and all filled with dragoons. Into one of those
I went, and found the ground-floor covered thickly
with straw, upon which the soldiers&mdash;about thirty
in all&mdash;were lying. They immediately made room
for me:&mdash;my servant slept with my horses in an
out-house. I was fatigued; and so, without any
other refreshment than a cup of commissariat grog,
lay down and slept happily until the trumpeter
sounded “<i>Boots and Saddles</i>:” this was at two
o’clock in the morning, and I had been asleep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
about three hours. The men were soon out and
horsed&mdash;so was I. The baggage of the dragoons
all packed and mounted&mdash;every thing ready for
“a breeze.” The morning was dark, and for
the time of year, rather chilly: I could not see to
a great distance, but within my view passed several
troops of heavy dragoons proceeding towards
the foot of the mountains. There was scarcely
any sound but that from the motion of the horses&mdash;the
men spoke but little, and were yet half
asleep. I moved towards the main road, in order
to come up with my division, which was in front;
but I soon found that it would be unsafe to proceed,
on account of a fog which arose, completely
obscuring every thing around. In consequence of
this I dismounted; took off my saddle; put it on
the ground; and directing my servant to stake the
horses to their tethers, lay down with my head
resting on it. I can assure my readers, that a
saddle is no bad substitute for a pillow when the
ground is the bed. The spot I selected was soft,
though not dry; it was in a furrow of a ploughed
field. I was rolled in my blanket, and for an
hour never enjoyed a sounder sleep: but I did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
not find the waking quite so pleasant; for it had
rained heavily during my <i>enjoyment</i>, and I felt myself
nearly covered by the <i>watery bed</i> of the furrow:
however, I shook off my blanket&mdash;saddled,
and mounted. It was daylight, but not yet sunrise:
as I proceeded towards the mountains, I
could see to my right, over the distant plain, several
bodies of horse evidently stationed to be ready
in case the enemy forced their way down&mdash;the
town of Pamplona on my left in the centre of
the plain&mdash;the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tricolore</i> flying, and occasional
guns&mdash;I suppose signals&mdash;firing. The Pyrenees
were capped in grey mist, and therefore I could
not discern any of our infantry upon them;
but I knew they were in their position there, and
had fought the two preceding days in defence
of it.</p>

<p>In my way I passed through the bivouac of the
Spanish army which blockaded Pamplona, and
there beheld a most sublime spectacle&mdash;it was the
celebration of their religious rites, the mass, in
the open air, close to a ruined house. It was now
sunrise, and the hour with the circumstances of
the time, gave the uncovered and kneeling soldiery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
a most interesting appearance. The priest was a
bald and reverend looking man, and his sacerdotal
robes made him look like a patriarch. I
stopped in a reverie of admiration&mdash;out of which,
however, I was roused in a few minutes by the
sound of distant firing on the heights; so I left
the Spaniards to their prayers, and galloped on
towards where there was something going on,
which to me was far more interesting.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes more I was upon the
mountain where our division was drawn up: they
had not yet fired a shot, nor seen a Frenchman,
but expected every moment to be engaged. The
scene of action here, is to be imagined by the reader
placing himself ideally on the top of a bold
hill, or moderately sized mountain; in front, and
on each side, are similar hills or mountains&mdash;some
smaller&mdash;some greater; far in the front the higher
Pyrenees; and, behind, the wide plain, on which
stands Pamplona. Over this scene let him then
throw the most picturesque foliage&mdash;a village or
two in the distant valleys&mdash;the ground spread with
heath and furze: thus he will have the view of
where the gallant battle of the Pyrenees was gained,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
after four days of terrible contest. The fight here
was very different from a fight on a plain: in this
it was a continual attempt on the part of Soult,
with all the force he could collect, to pass the
hills, for the relief of Pamplona, and as continual
a resistance on the part of the allies&mdash;hill after
hill was attacked and defended with the most heroic
energy on both sides. But our people performed
a still more glorious and prodigious task;
for not only did they defend their own position,
but attacked Soult’s, which was stronger than
their’s; and thus for the second time during the
campaign, made a wreck of the French army!</p>

<p>Soult was determined to pass to Pamplona if
possible; he therefore brought all his power to the
point: even his unfledged conscripts were not excused&mdash;boys
of fifteen, in white undress, unable
to use the bayonet; these he posted where they
could pull their triggers without being exposed to
a charge from our steel, while his veterans were
employed in more dangerous situations. Before the
attack, Soult in person appeared amongst them at
the front, pointed towards the invested town, and
offered every man a certain reward in cash, as soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
as they passed the few hills before them, and relieved
their blockaded countrymen. All this could
not suffice; and the best General of France, with
a powerful army, could not push over a quarter of
a mile of ground, while the British defended it!
nor although aware of the Duke of Wellington’s
intention of invasion, could they keep him from
pursuing them across their own frontiers! On
this battle depended the fate of the Peninsula&mdash;perhaps
of Europe:&mdash;the trust fell into worthy
hands, and they did their duty.</p>

<p>In about half an hour after I joined the division,
a hill in front and on our right, defended by Portuguese,
was attacked; the latter received the
French with a volley, and then, shouting, advanced
down the hill with the bayonet: a cheer from our
men involuntarily burst out, and the French rolled
and ran, pursued about a hundred yards. The
hill was of great importance to us, and very desirable
to the enemy: this was the first attack upon
it, and having failed, reinforcements were preparing
to accomplish its conquest:&mdash;we could see several
columns of the enemy moving down from another
mountain towards it; but this was provided for by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
our chief, who reinforced the gallant Portuguese
by the 48th British regiment, and a regiment of
Spaniards. Here then was the hardest fighting
for two days&mdash;the 27th and 28th; attacks were repeatedly
made upon this point, in the most able
manner by the French, and as often defeated.
Soult and Wellington were both placed within
sight of each other, upon the tops of hills,
anxiously observing this terrible strife at various
times; and the anxiety of the former could
be seen plainly in all his attitudes. During this
time several other points were assailed, gained and
lost: it was up hill at one moment, and down the
next; and considering that those hills were so
steep at some places, that I was nearly breathless
in mounting one, besides a hot sun blazing over
us, it is to be wondered how such prodigies of
valour were accomplished. I do not know why,
but certain it is, that our men usually did more
execution when charging up a hill than down;
there seemed to be a greater energy about them in
overcoming their difficulties, and perhaps a desire
of revenge for the advantage their enemy seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
to take of them in firing down at them as they
advanced. As an instance of this, I will mention
the following fact:&mdash;When our troops were passing
the Bidassoa, the firing from a bold height
on the French bank of the river galled them very
much; the water was up to the middle of their
bodies, and the men were obliged to hold their
muskets over their heads to keep them dry: many
fell; others, wounded, continued to cross the ford;
the hill in front was to be mounted and taken by
those troops in the water, and a strong force was
defending it. The men became outrageous as
they looked up at the muskets of their enemies
pointed at them; and frequent oaths and imprecations
plainly showed that they would seek satisfaction
when they crossed the river.&mdash;“<i>Oh! by
J&mdash;&mdash;! we’ll give it to you by and by, you French
beggars. D&mdash;&mdash;your eyes, we’ll sarve you out</i>,”
&amp;c. &amp;c. Such expressions as these were heard
from every man, and when arrived on the other
side of the river, scarcely a moment passed till
they were up on the heights&mdash;stabbing, butting,
and flinging over the rocks the bodies of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
enemies. The height was gained, and on the top
of it they gave three cheers, which made Fontarabia
ring. But&mdash;to the narrative.</p>

<p>During the 27th and 28th, the contest produced
nothing decisive, except that Soult could not gain
his point, and the whole line of hills were at one
time or other the scene of active operation&mdash;cannon,
musketry, and bayonet, were all at work.
On the 28th, the French made a desperate attack
on the 6th division, which had been sent by the
Duke of Wellington to occupy the heights on
the left, across a valley near Orican: the moment
this division appeared, the enemy advanced on it,
but was received in fine style&mdash;they got into a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul de sac</i>; for the fourth division on their left was
so placed on hills as to effect a most destructive
fire on their flank, while they gave them their vollies
from a ridge upon their right, as well as in
front, so that at this point the French met with
unequivocal defeat.</p>

<p>The third day closed in darkness, and the work
of death ceased for a time. The men were now so
familiar with the carnage around that they cared
nothing about it: many laid themselves down beside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
dead comrades and enemies mingled: all slept
soundly on the mountain heath that night&mdash;not
even bestowing a thought upon whether they were
to fight next day or not; and when the bugle
sounded and the drum beat next morning, jumped
up as fresh as if they had been at a review; then,
after eating their cold beef and biscuit, and swallowing
a mouthful of rum, were ready in their
ranks to renew the scenes of the preceding days&mdash;nay,
anxious for the fight.</p>

<p>This was the day for glory. The Duke attacked
Soult on the right and left at once,
which proving successful, he dashed at the centre.
This was now a change from defence to attack,
and the enemy in a few hours were driven from
all their strong points, and retreated. Yet they
fought desperately: at one village alone&mdash;the first
on the main road from Pamplona to the pass of
<i>Maia</i>&mdash;the British were driven back four times;
but took and held it on the fifth: the road here
was covered with dead of both sides, and well
proved the valour with which both fought, in that
masterly victory which opened the barrier of
France to the allies&mdash;led the Portuguese and Spaniards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
to the glory of shouting “Retribution” in
their persecutor’s country&mdash;and once more passed
the ranks of heroes over the consecrated ground
of Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>The whole of the road over which we pursued
the retreating and broken army, was covered with
the wreck of its baggage and artillery&mdash;hundreds
of dead mules were lying about, having been killed
with fatigue, or hurled off the precipices along
which the road sometimes passed&mdash;waggons, guns,
carriages, tumbrils, casks, medicine chests, and
dead men, were the objects that every where, like
Rosamond’s clue, marked the track of the devoted
victims:&mdash;a sickening sight, which, while engaged
in the heat of pursuit, was viewed without emotion;
but when calm reflection took her seat in
the soldier’s mind, was not to be contemplated
by him without unenviable feelings.</p>

<p>On this march nothing remarkable occurred in
the part of the army where I was stationed. The
siege of San Sebastian was begun by Sir Thomas
Graham, while the front of our main force occupied
the border line of France on the Bidassoa.
The two contending armies remained in sight of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
each other&mdash;Soult fortifying the frontier of his
threatened country, and Wellington refreshing
his victorious troops until after the fall of San
Sebastian. All this time the Duke’s head-quarters
were at Lesacco, in the mountains, a town about
four leagues south of Passages; and these four
leagues, I may say, with a little allowance&mdash;was
up <i>one</i> side of a mountain and down the
other,&mdash;a wretched town; and perhaps never before
had it to boast of the domicile of so many
heroes&mdash;such glittering nobility. Here, for the
greatest part of a rainy and raw winter, the indefatigable
Commander of the Forces fixed his quarters;
and here I have seen him working with an
energy which often threatened his life. He rode
so much one week, that he was confined for several
succeeding days to his bed; and I have seen his
fifteen valuable English chargers led out by the
groom to exercise, with scarcely any flesh on their
bones&mdash;so active and vigilant was their noble
rider, and so much were his horses used. Every
day during the siege of San Sebastian, I saw
the Duke, unattended by his staff, riding by
my window, in a narrow street of Renteria, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
his way to the besieged fortress, accompanied
by an old artillery or engineer officer,&mdash;I believe
Sir R. Fletcher,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>&mdash;and dressed in a plain grey
frock, white cravat, and cocked hat&mdash;evidently intent
on the matters of the siege; this was upwards
of thirty miles a day for a <i>ride</i>, between breakfast
and dinner; but he has often rode double that
distance, over the worst of roads and in the worst
of weather.</p>

<p>The siege of San Sebastian was the next important
operation of the Allied Army. This was
entrusted to Sir Thomas Graham, under the eye of
the Duke of Wellington. From being quartered
at Renteria, for three weeks previous to the capture
of that fortress, I had an opportunity of witnessing
the whole affair; and scarcely a day passed
without my visiting the works before it: but from
the commencement of the siege up to the battering
down of the walls, nothing took place to require a
particular notice, beyond the description I have
given of the siege of Flushing, in another part
of this work: generally speaking, the operations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
were similarly conducted. The storming of the
town, however, was a scene in the campaign of
which I write, which ought not to be passed over
unnoticed. As I beheld, so will I describe it; and
so mighty an achievement as the capture of this
town was, I would be happy to hear described by
every individual who was engaged in it; for each
would tell what he had seen; which, although all
generally the same, would be different in particulars,
and therefore, like Mosaic work, form a picture
of the highest value. We have had several
descriptions of the storming of San Sebastian,
amongst which that given by the author of “<i>The
Subaltern</i>,” (a deservedly popular work) is by far
the best, and, with but few exceptions, correctly
true&mdash;at least those exceptions are at variance
with what I recollect of the affair. The author
of “<i>The Subaltern</i>” describes what he saw, as a
<i>stormer</i> of the town; I can only speak as a spectator:
both our remarks, therefore, may be taken
as separate parts of the same picture.</p>

<p>San Sebastian is situated at the foot of a high
rock, upon the top of which is a fortified castle;
the town surrounds this rock, and is backed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the open sea. A river runs in front of the town,
into which the sea flows; but at low water it is
fordable; and its banks of yellow sand appear to
our right&mdash;imagining us fronting the town. On
first beholding San Sebastian, one supposes it is
situated on a little island; but on closer approach,
it is seen connected by a neck of land, which at
high water is very narrow; and on this neck, which
is an island at high water, is a fort mounting three
or four guns:&mdash;but the best way to proceed in the
description, I think, is to place my reader in the
position which I took up myself at the battering
and storming of the town.</p>

<p>To our right, on a high bold hill, which overtops
several others near it, and whose side, next
the town, is nearly perpendicular, was a mortar
battery:&mdash;here must the reader stand. About
half a mile in his front and a little to his left,
stands San Sebastian around its high rock and
castle&mdash;its walls watered by the Gurumea stream,
and relieved in the distance by the wide blue waters
of the Bay of Biscay. To the left of the town he
will see several picturesque hills, lessening away
into the horizon, while to his right he will behold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the Bay of Biscay washing the feet of the Pyrenees.
Immediately under him, a little to the
left, are situated the British batteries and trenches,
on a tolerably level ground, and flanked on the
other side by several hills, upon the most forward
of which stood the chief of the siege, Sir Thomas
Graham;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>&mdash;these, for the most part, covered with
apple-trees. Behind all this is a beautifully picturesque
and hilly country&mdash;the Lake of Leso
may be seen, like a patch of shining glass, in the
midst of foliage and fertile fields&mdash;an occasional
farm-house shows itself in the valleys and on the
brows of the hills&mdash;while the background is formed
by the gigantic mountains of the Pyreenees. I
can only compare the position which I have now
pointed out to my readers, to the highest seat of
an amphitheatre, at the bottom of which lies the
exhibition for his eye:&mdash;the batteries,&mdash;the river,&mdash;the
town,&mdash;the encamped army,&mdash;all were below;
and over the whole I could gaze as on the
Thames from the towers of Windsor,&mdash;the yellow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
verging sands of Dublin Bay from Killiny Hill,&mdash;or
Edinboro’ from the Calton.</p>

<p>On the night of the 26th, the fort between the
town and our lines was carried by assault, and its
defenders taken prisoners. This was done by a
detachment of infantry, assisted by a few marines
and sailors: little work was made about this affair,
and the garrison, it is supposed, were not
aware of it until daylight. On the morning of
the 27th, the signal was made to open the fire
upon the town; and I can only remember it by
having been awakened out of a sound sleep, at
three miles’ distance from San Sebastian, by the
tremendous roar of the cannon. The batteries
continued to play upon the town almost incessantly,
for nearly four days and nights,&mdash;the cannon
at the front wall, for the purpose of effecting
a breach&mdash;the mortars at the ramparts and the
houses. The French returned the fire from both
the Castle and walls with great rapidity&mdash;their
shells were thrown in every direction; but this
vigorous return was soon over; for, on the second
day of the cannonade, their guns on the walls were
silenced; so they contented themselves with throwing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
a few shells and an occasional shot from the
Castle upon the troops in our trenches, whose well-directed
muskets were annoying the enemy whenever
they appeared on the walls.</p>

<p>Observing the balls striking the wall at one
point, first led the beholders to suppose that
no impression could possibly be made on the
massive and compact structure; for the perceptible
effect was that a little dust arose from the
spot where each shot struck; and then the ball
dropped down, leaving no appearance whatever
of an impression: but continued firing first
loosened a stone, then moved it, and ultimately
displaced it: when this was accomplished, it required
very little more to widen the breach to a
sufficient extent for storming.</p>

<p>During the day-time the scene was awfully
grand&mdash;but far more so at night; and from the
hill upon which I stood, it had the most terrible
aspect. Fancy yourself over the potteries of Staffordshire
in a balloon, when the face of the country
is covered with fires; this may be likened in
some degree, to the trenches and ramparts&mdash;dark
and flame alternately mixed: then the roaring of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the guns, more loud than a thousand thunders;
and the shells crossing each other, in their route
to destruction:&mdash;none could behold the scene without
awe and horror!</p>

<p>The breach having been completed on the 30th,
the storming party prepared to enter; and on the
31st at about ten o’clock in the morning, the forlorn
hope, at the appointed time&mdash;which was the
hour of low-water&mdash;advanced from the trenches.
I could see them plainly: one followed the other
rapidly into the stream, and boldly advanced&mdash;poor
fellows! a thousand balls were showered on
them, and they dropped as fast as they arrived at
about the middle of the river&mdash;men followed men,
into the gulph of death&mdash;yet several arrived at the
opposite bank: on they went to the breach, followed
by their comrades, and there were knocked
down by grape and bullets from the walls:
but by rapidly crowding over the heaped up
dead, a mass of men succeeded in getting on the
breach: there they were stopped by balls and
bayonets. At this moment, a mine sprung outside
the wall, and threw our advancing men into confusion,
killing several; but under the cover of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
smoke occasioned by it, many of the rear got up to
the breach. Sir Thomas Graham now ordered the
heavy artillery to aim over the heads of our men,
so as to clear the ramparts of the opposing force,
through the embrasures: this was admirably done:
I could see the balls striking above them, and
knocking stones and rubbish in upon the French,
as well as sweeping them away.&mdash;Every shot made
my heart thrill with delight; for the poor fellows,
who were struggling to get into the breach, against
such fearful odds, were dropping every instant;
but this masterly experiment made immediate way
for advance. There were several Spanish females
on the hill where I was, and the tears rolled down
their cheeks like rain, while this was going on; and
many of the <i>men</i> who beheld it could not refrain
from weeping. The constant exclamations from
one to another, was, “Do you think they are likely
to get in?&mdash;How long they are on the breach!&mdash;God
help them!&mdash;Brave fellows!”&mdash;Not only the
English present, but the Spanish, thus heartily
felt for the gallant soldiers who were standing
on the threshold of death awaiting destruction.
At this moment, a column of Portuguese advanced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
boldly out over the sand, on the right of the town,
and exactly under the battery in which I stood: they
marched at ordinary time. As soon as they appeared,
the grape was showered in amongst them, and
strewed the yellow sands with the blue jackets;
yet the column never broke, but intrepidly marched
into the river up to the arm-pits, and gained
the wall of the town; the water all around them,
while passing, bubbling by shot as if from large
hail&mdash;so it appeared to me from the distance. The
Portuguese continued along the wall, and mounted
the breach gallantly. All this time, the breach
was receiving a most destructive flanking fire, from
the projections of the walls on both sides&mdash;they
kept up a continual shower of bullets from the embrasures;
fortunately now a mine sprung on the
ramparts by accident, and destroyed numbers of
the French: a dense black cloud of smoke arose
from it: our artillery was sweeping the ramparts,
and at this juncture the surviving men on the
breach cleared their way into the town&mdash;advancing
columns followed fast&mdash;the batteries ceased&mdash;and
the work of the British bayonet began. The
hearts of all who beheld the attack were now at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
ease&mdash;the artillery men rested on their guns, and
shook hands with each other&mdash;all was quiet outside
the town, but wild uproar and destruction
within. In about half an hour after this, we could
see the French mounting the rock inside the citadel,
to shut themselves up in the castle; then we
felt convinced that the town was taken. The
French continued to fire upon their pursuers all
the way up the hill, and we could track them by
the smoke of their guns.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>I went into the town through the breach, in the
evening, and there witnessed the true horrors of
war; the soldiers were, for the most part, half drunk&mdash;all
were busy plundering and destroying: every
thing of value was ransacked&mdash;furniture thrown out
of the windows&mdash;shops rifled&mdash;packages of goods
torn open and scattered about&mdash;the streets close to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the breach, as well as the breach itself, covered with
dead and wounded:&mdash;over these bodies, of necessity,
I passed on my way. As few women were
in the town, the horrors attending the sex under
such circumstances were also few; and the attempt
at ill-treating a female on the day subsequent to
the capture of the town, was summarily punished
by Lord Beresford on the spot. It was thus: although
plunder was nearly subdued on the day
after entering San Sebastian, yet stragglers were
prowling about in spite of all efforts to prevent
further mischief: a woman was looking out of a
window on the first floor of a house, and I saw a
drunken Portuguese soldier run into the passage
directly below where the woman was. Lord
Beresford happened to be walking a little before
me in a plain blue coat and cocked hat, accompanied
by another officer: his Lordship saw the
Portuguese running into the house, and presently
we heard the screams of a female&mdash;the woman
had gone from the window. Lord Beresford instantly
followed the Portuguese, and in a few minutes
brought his senhorship down by the collar;
then with the flat of his sword gave the fellow that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
sort of a drubbing which a powerful man, like his
Lordship, is capable of inflicting. Under the circumstances
I thought it well bestowed, and far
better than trying him by court martial.</p>

<p>I understood that when the troops got into the
town, the French retreated behind their barricades
in the streets, made with barrels of sand and
clay; from whence they fired at their pursuers,
and when driven from one, fled to the next, until
they gained the Castle-hill. It is thus the French
generally fight against our troops&mdash;they take
every advantage of screening themselves from shot,
and but on very few occasions stand up man to
man with the bayonet.</p>

<p>The town was dreadfully injured by shot, shell,
and the destructive fury of our troops:<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> but by
no means so dilapidated as Flushing was. A great
number of the inhabitants had left San Sebastian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
previous to its blockade, and the few respectable
families who remained, fled to the Castle along
with the French.</p>

<p>For several days after the storming, soldiers
and sailors were to be seen strutting about the
roads outside the town in masquerade&mdash;some in
silks and satins&mdash;others as pedlars selling their
plunder to the people who came from Passages to
see the wreck of San Sebastian: the roads were
like a fair; and the humour of the Portuguese and
our sailors glossed over the horrors of the time with
strange mirth. In general the sailors were habited
in old fashioned silk gowns and petticoats, put on
over their tarry jackets; while on a battered sail-cloth
hat, Jack sported a Spanish veil. The garrison
in the Castle held out a week, but at the end
of that time surrendered: the number marched
out was, I believe, 1,800.</p>

<p>From the fall of San Sebastian, until the invasion
of France in the month following, nothing
particular took place, and the army reposed in the
luxuriant valleys of Navarre. Here both officers
and men enjoyed themselves in quiet: they had
plenty of provision&mdash;plenty of forage for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
horses&mdash;a profusion of fruit and excellent wine&mdash;the
weather was delightful, and the country the
most picturesque on earth. However, little more
than a month passed over before the army crossed
the Bidassoa, driving the enemy from their frontier,
and our successful commander established his
head quarters at <i>St. Jean de Luz</i>. I had been
quartered at Tafalia from a week after the siege
until the fall of Pamplona, and that being the
only fortress to impede the operations of the
army&mdash;from its being occupied by the enemy&mdash;it
is not unlikely that its fall was the signal for the
invasion of France.</p>

<p>On the surrender of Pamplona, the French garrison
were permitted to march out, with closed
knapsacks. They were escorted by the Spaniards
through Tolosa to Passages for embarkation as
prisoners of war; and, unhappily for many of
them, they found the difference between Spanish
and British foes on that miserable occasion.</p>

<p>It was cold weather when the garrison marched
out: they were disarmed of course. The French
governor and several of the superior officers were
allowed to ride their own horses, and suffered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
nothing more severe than mere insults from their
escort, the Spaniards. Far different was it with
the men: every species of brutality was practised
against them short of open massacre. The road
from Pamplona to Tolosa is one of the widest
and best in Spain, not very inferior to any in
Great Britain: it takes a course through valleys
along the sides of an immense mountain for a
considerable way, and, frequently, over patches of
fertile country&mdash;the whole abounding in foliage.
Occasional villages present themselves at a few
miles distant from each other, and now and then a
farm house or two opens upon the traveller’s view
in some wild spot.</p>

<p>I was on my route from Tafalia, in company
with a brother officer; and then returning to the
front. We slept one night in a village within a
mile and a half of Pamplona, as one of our halting
places; and next day in passing the town we saw
a considerable body of Spanish troops&mdash;principally
cavalry&mdash;drawn up; and, on enquiry, learnt that
they were waiting to receive the French garrison,
which were then about to march out as prisoners
of war. In a few moments the French appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
and were placed in column to proceed thus on their
route to Tolosa. We marched with them all that
day, conversing with the governor&mdash;a gentlemanly
and pleasant officer&mdash;who expressed his fears of ill
treatment for his men, regretting that it was not
by the English that they were escorted. It came
on to snow severely about four o’clock in the afternoon,
and promised a most miserable night to the
poor prisoners, as they had a full league farther
to go before they could get under cover; and they
were far less able to bear fatigue than the Spaniards
who escorted them; for they had been
half starved in the garrison&mdash;provisions having
been exhausted:&mdash;the governor declared that
they had all been subsisting for twelve days previous
to surrender, on four ounces <i>of horse flesh</i>
per day to each man, and that the horses killed
for that purpose were the private property of the
officers.</p>

<p>We rode along with the column until dark,
when we left it to take up our quarter for the
night at a farm-house, which we saw on the left, in
a valley, at the distance of about a quarter of a
mile. Here we passed the time pleasantly, having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
met with hospitable people who accommodated us
with what we wished. My friend had purchased
a brace of woodcocks in the village where we
slept on the previous night, and my servant was
busy cooking them: while we sat at the fire along
with the farmer, his wife and three children, enjoying
ourselves with a glass of good Tafalia wine,
about seven o’clock, a youth who was in the employ
of the farmer, lifted the latch, and entered,
covered with snow; his face was as white as his
clothes, and he evidently laboured under extreme
terror. His master demanded what was the matter&mdash;in
the Basque language, which we did not understand,
and which is the language of the country
people in that quarter: the boy, in the most apparently
incoherent manner, spoke for several minutes,
shuddering as he spoke. We supposed that he
had encountered a mountain ghost in full costume;
but the master explained in Spanish the cause of
his servant’s fright to be nothing etherial. He said
that the boy had been returning from a neighbouring
farmer’s house, and was crossing the main road
in the snow, when he stumbled over something,
and fell; it was quite dark; at first he thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
it was a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Borachio</i>,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> or a sack of corn that thus
tripped him, and put down his hand to it. He
felt it warm, and on closer examination found
it to be a dead body quite naked, and bleeding
warm blood from the throat and breast, with which
the boy’s hands were covered. He ran towards a
gap to get into the field which led him towards his
master’s, and in climbing up, his foot slipped by
occasion of the snow, and down he fell into the
ditch upon another dead, naked, and bleeding
body! At first I was at a loss to account for this
extraordinary affair, but the Spaniard, who was
a shrewd man, soon awakened me to the cause.
“They are French,” said he;&mdash;“French prisoners
killed by the soldiers of the escort, for
their knapsacks and clothes.” A shudder of horror
passed through the nerves of both my friend and
myself. At first we thought of proceeding on
after the column, and to remonstrate with the
Spanish Commanding-officer; but a moment’s reflection
showed us the uselessness as well as danger
of such an undertaking: we therefore contented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
ourselves with condemning the dastard
villany of the action, and in plans of preventing
the like outrages for the remainder of the march.</p>

<p>The next morning we mounted our horses a little
after daylight, and proceeded to the main road in
order to pursue our route to Tolosa, and there the
scene which opened upon us was one of the most
heart-sinking nature: at least thirty bodies were
scattered along the road, for the distance of about
two miles; most of them stabbed in the breast,
side, and abdomen&mdash;others with their throats cut;
and some who had not died of their wounds were
gasping in death, hastened by the extreme inclemency
of the weather to which they had been
exposed the whole of the night&mdash;and all completely
naked! We stopped with one young man who could
just speak a little; I put my canteen to his lips,
and he swallowed a mouthful of brandy, which for
a moment lighted up the expiring spark of life.
The suffering victim told us that the Spanish soldiers
stabbed him in the breast when it became
quite dark. He said that happening to be on the
flank of the column, and being a little tired and
weak, he straggled out from it a moment, when one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of the Spaniards dragged him into the ditch and
plunged his steel into his body; then took off his
knapsack and clothes, leaving him naked as he was,
exposed all night to the snow and sleet. We
threw our blankets down, and lifted him upon
them&mdash;the blood gushed out afresh from his side.
We immediately commenced to carry him back to
the house we had slept in the preceding night;
but before we had gone many yards with the unhappy
soldier, he died.</p>

<p>We lost no time in proceeding onwards to overtake
the column, and we came up with it in about
two hours. The poor jaded prisoners looked at
us as if they thought we could protect them from
their abominable persecutors, and many of them
begged our interference, and corroborated what
the dying soldier told us. We heard the same
melancholy complaint from the French commandant
and his officers. He said he remonstrated with
the commanding-officer of the Spaniards, but was
answered that the men should keep close in the
column, and then they would not be exposed to
the danger of being murdered! My friend and
I immediately rode up to the Spanish officer in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
command, and represented the horrid scene which
was acted on the preceding night; but instead of
a humane and soldier-like consideration of the report,
he cooly observed that <i>he</i> did not see them
doing it, and that the prisoners must be more
careful not to straggle. I asked him to investigate
the matter, and concluded by hoping that the
horrors of the night before would not be renewed
that night. My friend added, that it was a disgrace
to the name of a nation to murder their prisoners
thus. He said he could not help it, and that these
things must happen in spite of the officers. We
plainly saw that those men, who from their rank
should have been supposed to have known better,
were indirectly as much of the base assassin as the
wretches they commanded: however, I believe they
were not the <i>regular</i> troops of the line, but the
militia of the province. God forbid that all the
Spanish army were such as this sample! For the
sake of human nature, I hope they were not. The
Spaniards had certainly suffered much from the
French invading army; but nothing should have
operated so disgraceful a crime in them, as to
murder the helpless prisoners <i>entrusted to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
protection</i>. The British soldiers, with all their
faults, never stained the name of their country
with conduct like this: they have pilfered&mdash;they
have plundered&mdash;they have rioted in drunkenness
and debauchery; but they never <i>struck a prostrate
foe</i>: they were the most formidable enemies to the
French in Spain; but they were the first to whom
the fallen of that nation looked to for protection&mdash;and
not in <i>vain</i>&mdash;except in one <i>grand instance</i> * * *
But in this, thank Heaven! the <i>Nation</i>, although
bearing the blame, <i>unjustly bears it</i>; for <i>it was the
act of its evil director, and wholly unsanctioned
by the hearts of its people</i>.</p>

<p>We obtained a sort of promise, however, from
the Spanish officers, not again to allow such conduct
as disgraced the preceding night; and having cautioned
the French in the rear to keep close together,
we went to our quarters in a little village,
with some hopes that the murderers would not
again go to their infernal work; but we were disappointed;
for next morning the front room of the
cottage in which we passed the night, was filled
with Spanish soldiers at day-break, (for it happened
to be a sort of wine-house,) and every one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
of them had a knapsack or two which they took
from the French on the preceding evening: and no
doubt for every knapsack which we counted, there
was a murdered prisoner. We were horror-struck
when we beheld them, and spoke in very decided
terms of the brutality of the soldiers; but they
only replied by recommending the English officers
to mind their own men, and let Spaniards do as they
liked!&mdash;nay, they made no secret of their atrocity,
but boasted to each other of the manner in which
they selected the prisoners who carried the largest
knapsacks, and of the celerity with which they detached
them from their comrades and slaughtered
them. These wretches held a sort of fair or
market in front of this cottage, selling the clothes
and contents of the plundered knapsacks to the
peasants of the village.</p>

<p>This proved to be the last day of slaughter
for the poor unhappy prisoners; for they arrived
at Tolosa that evening by four o’clock, and their
further march was only to Passages (one day’s
march) where they were to embark. My friend
and I, however, to guard against further outrage,
reported the affair to the Spanish authorities at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Tolosa, who, although promising to effectually
prevent a recurrence, <i>excused</i> the murderers by
saying, “that they had not received a shilling pay
for two years; and this,” said they, “is owing to
these infernal French.” There would have been
some reason in this, if the murdered had been the
men who designed and moved the Spanish invasion;
but these unhappy prisoners were as much
the victims of it as the Spaniards themselves.</p>

<p>I now proceeded to my quarters at <i>Urogne</i>,
beyond the Bidassoa, between <i>Fontarabia</i> and <i>St.
Jean de Luz</i>. From the appearance of the town,
the armies must have had severe fighting there:
the houses were all in ruins, and no inhabitants to
be seen: here I remained until the advance of the
army to its ultimate conquest at Toulouse, which
began the winter’s campaign in France.&mdash;But, as
the crossing of the Bidassoa, properly speaking,
was the end of the <i>Last Campaign in the Peninsula</i>,
I must with it conclude this sketch&mdash;on
which I have already, perhaps, dwelt too long.

<h2 id="NIGHTS_IN_THE_GUARD_HOUSE_V">NIGHTS IN THE GUARD-HOUSE.<br />

No. V.</h2>

<p>“Holloa! what is that, sentry?”</p>

<p>“They are firing on the hills, sir.”</p>

<p>Out ran Sergeant Dobson from the guard-house,
and looked through the dark towards the point
from which he supposed the muskets had been
fired.</p>

<p>“They are at it, sure enough,” said he&mdash;“Pop!&mdash;there
they go. Is that a house o’ fire?”</p>

<p>“I think it is, sir,” replied the sentry.</p>

<p>The Sergeant now ran to a rising ground, behind
the guard-house to satisfy himself, by taking
an observation. It was a dark, cold, windy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
night, and the flames from a burning house upon
a hill, about half a mile in front of the spot
where the sergeant stood, spread a glare of red
and white light upon the objects immediately
around it, which had a sublime effect. The sergeant
could plainly distinguish the figures of soldiers,
between him and the flames, running until
they disappeared in the darkness of the valley
over which the flames waved; and he was now convinced
that a desperate resistance must have been
made to the party, that was sent to support the
excise-officers, in taking possession of a private
still, which had long been at work in the house
now burning in sight of the sergeant.</p>

<p>The house where the illicit still produced its
periodical flow of potyeen, was an old strong stone
building, of three stories high, and partly in ruin.
The lands upon which it was situated, and of
which it had been once the manor-house, were “in
chancery,” and the only inhabitants it possessed,
were a sort of steward and his family, who received
no pay for his services, except his house-room
and firing, with leave to grow potatoes in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
the garden, and feed a cow on the estate&mdash;sometimes,
perhaps, a pig or two. The agent of the
estate seldom visited the ruin, unless when he took
a shooting excursion; and then he did not trouble
himself much with the old steward’s means of
living. To make up for all deficiencies in salary,
the occupier of the house, in conjunction with
others, set up “a bit of a still,” as he termed it,
and supplied thereby a considerable part of the
neighbouring people, with potyeen and broken
heads for several years, under the very noses of
the excise-officers, who were either too wise, or too
blind to take notice of the matter. The rumour
was not without foundation, which hinted that
several mugs and canteens of the old steward’s
<i>best</i>, found their way into Ballycraggen guard-house.
This, however, was only rumoured, and
never happened to arrive at the ears of the officers
then quartered in the town; for had that been
the case, Corporal O’Callaghan, Private Mulligan,
Jack Andrews, and even Sergeant M’Fadgen
himself, would have got into a bit of a hobble,
as sure as potyeen is good whiskey. But not a
word more about that&mdash;let the officers find such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
things out&mdash;I’ll never “peach,” upon good soldiers.
If they did take a drop while on guard, it
was only to keep the frost out of their stomachs&mdash;(and
as Mulligan says,) nobody ever saw them “a
bit the worse o’ dthrink.”</p>

<p>The burning of the house was going on rapidly&mdash;the
flames encreasing in strength, and streaming
along the hill, over high pines and thick bush
wood. The whole of the guard were at the front
of the guard-house, observing the progress of
the fire, when the glistening of the firelocks with
fixed bayonets caught their attention, rising from
the valley below them; and, through the faint
and red light, they could perceive they were some
of their own regiment who approached.</p>

<p>The guard immediately got under arms, to receive
them. The challenge was given&mdash;the watch
word passed&mdash;and the party commanded by Ensign
Morris, halted in front of the guard-house,
and delivered to the sergeant of the guard (Dobson)
two prisoners&mdash;one slightly wounded by a
shot in the arm.</p>

<p>The Ensign gave orders that they should be
kept in the guard-house until morning, and left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Corporal Callaghan with two men, to strengthen
the guard: after which, he gave the word to his
party, “Right face,”&mdash;“March;” and proceeded
to the head-quarters of the regiment.</p>

<p>The prisoners were two labourers who belonged
to the still, and the only two of its defenders who
were taken.</p>

<p>“Well, my gay fellows, you gave us a purty bit
o’ business to-night&mdash;eh?” growled Corporal O’Callaghan,
when all were seated in the guard-house.
“Look at that,” continued he, taking off his cap,
and showing them a hole made by a bullet; “look
at that, ye spalpeens. Which o’ ye did that?”</p>

<p>“Neither of us, plase your honour!” exclaimed
both the prisoners; “we never fired a shot, at
all, at all.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie, old chap,” replied one of the
soldiers who had escorted them; “that’s a lie;
for I’ll take my affadavy I saw your infernal face
looking out of the window when the fire first
broke out; and if I’m not very much mistaken,
it was this musquet that pinked your arm when
you were running up the hill.”</p>

<p>“Whoever <i>did</i> pink my arm, as you call it, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
wish’d o’ Christ I had him on the top o’ Faudrick’s
Hill,&mdash;he with his firelock, an’ I with my pitchfork;
I’d make him know his Lord God from
Tom Bell.” This was the reply of the wounded
man, who became evidently agitated with rage
as he concluded.</p>

<p>“Well, my boys,” observed Corporal Callaghan,
“it’s all over now; you are prisoners, and
one o’ you is wounded. The business is over, so
say no more about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Sergeant Dobson, “say no
more about it;&mdash;but, Corporal, tell us how the
matter went.”</p>

<p>“By my soul! Sergeant, we had a throublesome
job, I assure you. You know Andrews’s quarthers.
Well, I was down there, taking tay with his wife,
when the Sergeant-major came running down, and
orther’d me out with my squad immajetly. So I
had my men out while you’d say ‘thrapstick;’ an’
Liftinent Morris, of our company, with Sergeant
M’Fadgen, myself, and twenty-five men, march’d
off in the dark, along with two excisemen, down
the narrow lane which lades towards the windmill.
The lane was rough an’ muddy, an’ it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
horrid dark; but the excisemen had lantherns in
their pockets, which they pull’d out as soon as we
were out o’ the town. When we got about a mile
on, we filed off into a narrow path, which ran up
the side o’ the hill, upon which that house that’s
burning stands, an’ followed the excisemen in
single files, through bushes an’ briars, like goats&mdash;climbing
an’ slipping&mdash;till we came to a sort of open
space, undther another hill; an’ from this we could
see a gleam o’ twilight in the sky, as if the moon
was just washing her face, to pay us a visit. Here
we were halted, an’ orther’d to keep a sthrict silence.
The excisemen shut up their lantherns.
Ensign Morris now stooped down, to catch a
glimpse o’ the house in front between him an’ the
twilight; an’ then both he and the excisemen
went on&mdash;down the slope o’ the hill. It got a little
bit lighter, an’ we could see that the big stone
house (more like a castle) was situated between us
and another hill on our left, in a wide sloping
place, and surrounded with fir-threes. There was
no light at all in the windows. ’Pon my sowl,
when I looked about at the dark scene, as it was&mdash;we
dthrawn up undther a steep rock, an’ the roots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
o’ the big threes out over our heads,&mdash;all of us as
silent as stones&mdash;I couldn’t help thinking o’ the
night we were dthrawn up on the advanced posts
in the Pyrenees, Sergeant,&mdash;just half an hour before
the attack. Well&mdash;in about ten minutes, Liftinent
Morris an’ the excisemen returned. Misther
Morris immajetly addthress’d us in a sort o’
whisper, ‘Tention!’ says he. “Now, men, you
are about to be employed in a juty which may
call upon every individual of you to use his judgment
and discretion. You may be required to
spill the blood of your countrymen; but it is in
support o’ the laws, and you are bound to do
it, if necessity calls upon you. These revenue
officers are going to make a sazure of a private
still in that house, an’ in case our assistance is
wanted, we must give it at all hazards; but to
those men who will be posted by themselves, I
have particularly to remark that they are to allow
none to pass them&mdash;but, at the same time, not to
fire, unless undther the most urgent circumstances.
To those men undther my own eye, I say observe
my ordthers&mdash;our object is to avoid bloodshed,
but, at the same time, support the revenue officers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
in doing their juty.” He then ordthered Sergeant
M’Fadgen to post two men at the pass we had
just come down; and this being done, three more
were sent round to about fifty yards distance, an’
posted at different points, while four others were
placed at each flank o’ the big house on the side o’
the hill&mdash;all ordthered to allow nobody to pass in
or out; an’ not to move from their posts till further
ordthers, unless obliged by force. Ensign
Morris then marched the remaining twelve, and
the Sergeant and myself, down the slope for about
a hundthred yards, an’ halted us undther cover o’
the wail, close to the gate o’ the house.</p>

<p>“The excisemen now went softly into the yard
o’ the house&mdash;for there was no gate&mdash;an’ in about
five minutes they came out again, to say that
there were at least eight or ten men in the house&mdash;they
saw through a crack in the wall. I must
tell ye that the excisemen said they had been in
the house twice, but it was in the day time, an’ if
they were to be d&mdash;&mdash;d for it, they could not
find either still or one o’ the men,&mdash;it was so sacretly
done between ’em; so they came to-night
from information they had received, that a grate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
quantity o’ potyeen was to be sent out about twelve
o’clock; an’ we were to wait ’till they began to
load their cars with the stuff.&mdash;‘The cars are all
harnessed,’ says one o’ the Excisemen, coming
out o’ the yard, ’an’ I hard a dale o’ voices inside&mdash;so
they will soon come out.’</p>

<p>“Here we waited for a little time, when a light
from the door stramed out across the road through
the gateway, and the excisemen got on their
hands an’ feet, an’ kept watching the fellows coming
out o’ the house to load the stuff. We heard
the cars dthrawing up before the door, and in
about five minutes the excisemen got up, and said
that they would creep inside o’ the gate, an’ round
the wall to the door, so as to get into the house
before any alarm was given; an’ that the word
“Captain!” roared out by one o’ them, would be
the signal for our party to advance an’ support
them. So in they crept, like cats, while the men
were loading the cars: and we were expecting the
signal every instant, when we sees a fellow’s head
poking out o’ the gate: at first he didn’t see us,
but walked softly out (I suppose to see was the
ground clear), when he turned round an’ spies us,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
an’ immajetly bawled out, as loud as he could,
‘Murther! Dinis, shut the door; here’s the sodgers!’
The signal was instantly given; we didn’t
mind the fellow at the gate, but advanced at double
quick, right into the yard&mdash;Ensign Morris at
our head. The door was open&mdash;a woman held a
light, an’ was pulling in a man, while the excisemen
were both knocked down like cocks before
our faces. We were dthrawn up in line about
ten yards from the door, while Ensign Morris ran
forward, undther one o’ the horses’ heads, calling
out he would fire if they would not surrendther;
but the men were all in, an’ the door slapped right
into his face, just as he was grabbing howld o’ one
o’ them. You know Misther Morris is a slapping
able fellow, that ought to be a Captain long ago&mdash;before
he left Spain. The excisemen got up&mdash;not
much worse o’ the wear&mdash;an’ Misther Morris
ordthered me to remove the cars an’ horses,
which we did to one side o’ the yard. He then
called to the men to aim at the door when they
got the word, and desired the Excisemen to pull
out their lantherns, one of which he took, an’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
threw the light on the door. “Now men:&mdash;ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire!”
says he. Slap went a dozen
bullets into the door. “Load!” was given, an’
the officer, with the Excisemen, went forward,&mdash;the
men marched afther him,&mdash;ordthered to
butt the door with their muskets; which they
did: but neither the balls nor the butting had
any effect whatever; for the door was as thick
double oak as ever was; an’ well made too&mdash;one
o’ the owld times.”</p>

<p>The prisoners smiled with satisfaction, as the
Corporal observed upon the door.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued O’Callaghan, “we were
dthrawn up a little distance from the house again,
an’ another volley was sent right at one o’ the
windows o’ the first floor. In went the wooden
shutthers in smithereens about the ground, an’
slap comes a shot out at us. “Load!”&mdash;again&mdash;and
again. Six men were ordthered to take post
on our flank with the Sergeant, and the others with
Misther Morris himself:&mdash;away went six bullets
more into the same window, from the Sergeant’s
party, while ours was ordthered to pop one by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
one, as Misther Morris directed. Another shot
was now fired at us from the window, an’ knocked
poor Hall head over heels.”</p>

<p>“What! is Hall killed?” demanded the Serjeant
and the men of the guard.</p>

<p>“‘Faith! poor fellow he is&mdash;or all as one; the
ball enthered his breast, an’ he was taken away
to the surgeon with very little hopes o’ life.”</p>

<p>At this information of the Corporal’s there was
a general murmur of regret.</p>

<p>O’Callaghan continued&mdash;“Misther Morris now
says to the men, ‘Come&mdash;ready lads&mdash;an’ when the
party on the other side fires, watch the window,
while I throw the light right on it; which, when
you see, fire at once&mdash;the whole of you.’ We then
moved in the dark to six or eight paces farther
out, an’ more in front. The smoke was now getting
away&mdash;for a blast o’ wind just then came. In
about a minuet or two, slap went the Serjeant’s
party&mdash;a volley into the window. ‘Steady!’ says
the Liftinent; ‘good aim lads’; an’ in less than a
minuet he claps the light on the window. There
was the fellow with a blundtherbush up to his
shouldther, an’ he let fly just as we fired&mdash;the light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
was kept steady on him&mdash;I’m sure every man
could see him. Rattle went the lead into him:&mdash;he
jumped like a hopping ball up against the window
top, an’ out fell his dead body across the ledge:&mdash;there
he hung with his head an’ shoulders out.
A most dthreadful cloud o’ smoke came now over
the house, an’ almost stifled us; at which Misther
Morris ordthered me to go round to the rear
an’ see what was the matther. I went, an’ the
sentheries there tould me the house was o’ fire&mdash;’faith!
I soon saw it was; for the flames were bursting
out o’ the windows; so I ran back to tell the
Liftinent. We were all astonishment. What was
to become o’ the men inside?</p>

<p>“There was no more firing from the party:
the Serjeant was ordthered to remain at his post
in front, with his six men, while Misther Morris
an’ I ran round to the rear; but before we went,
the flames came fleaking out of every window&mdash;even
over the dead man that was lying stretched
out over the ledge. It’s all up, thinks I,
for they must ha’ spilt their potyeen, an’ set
fire to it; otherwise the house could never be so
suddenly in flames.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>“Faith an’ you’re just right,” sneered the
wounded prisoner; “We wasn’t a goin’ to let the
d&mdash;&mdash;d Exciseman taste a dthrop o’ it.”</p>

<p>“By my sowl! ye’re nice boys. I wish ye had
been out at Badajoz, an’ may be ye’d ha’ had
enough o’ such business,” said Corporal O’Callaghan,
and then resumed his narrative. “Well,”
said he, “we got round as fast as possible to the
rear o’ the house, an’ just as we were approaching
it, we sees the senthries&mdash;three o’ them&mdash;running towards
the hill to stop three or four fellows who
were galloping up it like monkies, an’ calling out
that they would fire; while six or eight fellows
made a rush by a hedge close to us, down the hill
like devils, an’ we afther them&mdash;officer an’ all.
I’m a good runner&mdash;an’ by my sowl! I could not
do much with them fellows; they were like Leberacawns&mdash;we
had scarcely time to wink our eyes, when
they were gone&mdash;hooh! off they were like birds.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t Lieutenant Morris order you to
fire, Corporal?” said Serjeant Dobson.</p>

<p>“Fire! not he. Why should he, Serjeant?
You know what the Liftenant is,&mdash;he’ll not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
dthraw blood in such a case as that&mdash;the poor
devils were running away. We couldn’t have
much glory in killing one o’ them, I’m sure. One
o’ the senthries fired though, an’ shot this nate-looking
gentleman here getting up the hill, an’
made him prisoner; the other lad there fell right
on his head and rowled down; so that he was also
caught.”</p>

<p>“And is the house burnt?” demanded the Serjeant.</p>

<p>“Burnt!” replied O’Callaghan, “’faith it is&mdash;an’
well burnt too. It’s all in a hape o’ ruins.
An’ afther all, the Exciseman didn’t get the
still.”</p>

<p>“No, by J&mdash;&mdash;s! they didn’t nor never will,”
exclaimed the wounded prisoner with exultation.</p>

<p>“But what made you burn the house?” said
Serjeant Dobson to the prisoner.</p>

<p>“I’ll say no more,” replied he; “it’s done now&mdash;an’
I’m not sorry; except for the brave fellow
that lost his life.”</p>

<p>At this moment, the Sentry at the guard-house
door challenged; and in a few seconds Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Morris with a magistrate of the town, and
the gaoler, arrived. Handcuffs were placed upon
the prisoner who was not wounded, and the Corporal
with two men, were directed to take charge
of the delinquents, and march them to gaol; which
they did, accompanied by the Lieutenant, the
magistrate, and the gaoler.

<h2 id="HOLY_ORDERS">HOLY ORDERS.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O! Father, must I then confess?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They say that “a frank confession is good for
the soul,” but who ever said it was good for a
military <i>body</i>? Even the confessors themselves,
enthusiastic as they may be about the salvation of
souls, through the means of contrition and atonement,
show but little disposition to trouble the
army, or expect that the army will ever trouble
them by kneeling at their confessionals. However,
the military in France are subject to the civil laws;
and, as a holy order has been issued from the Court
of Charles X., imposing the necessity of confession
as a preparatory step to the celebration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
marriage, the soldier who wishes to enter into the
bonds of Hymen, must, like his civil brethren,
confess his naughty doings to his pastor. Without
a certificate of having duly done this, he must
be contented with single cursedness.</p>

<p>A Colonel who fought for France in the days
of her triumph&mdash;a pupil of that revolutionary
school which gave its best moral lesson in its
downfall&mdash;presented himself at the house of the
Priest who held the sacerdotal command of the
town in which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">militaire</i> was quartered, and
informed him that he was desirous of entering
into the married state next day; adding, that he
wished to give his reverence the preference in the
performance of the ceremony. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Prêtre</i>
bowed, and thanked the Colonel for the honour
conferred upon him, and the hour was appointed
for the marriage. The Colonel, not aware that
anything more was officially required of him, than
to present himself with his intended <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cara esposa</i>,
before the altar on the following day, was about to
take his leave, when the Priest informed him that
he must confess before he could be eligible to the
dignity of wearing the matrimonial collar.&mdash;Only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
fancy a tall, bony, mustachioed Colonel of French
Infantry, about forty-five years of age&mdash;a sort of
half devil, half republican,&mdash;with ear-rings and
bald temples&mdash;a ruddy brown face, that spoke of
many a hot sun and strong vintage&mdash;with an eye
like Mars, and an air like Robin Hood:&mdash;only
fancy such a man called upon by a Priest, to
kneel down and confess his sins in an audible
voice, that he might be qualified to enter into
the holy state of marriage;&mdash;and then fancy his
gaze of astonishment at the holy man’s summons!
For such a rough personage as this was the Colonel;&mdash;a
fellow who, during his military life, had little
to do with priests, except to lay them under contribution,
and knew no more about the merits of
confession than he did about the Evidences of
Christianity, or the Decalogue itself.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacre!</i>” replied the Colonel; “What’s the
meaning of this? Confession! what have I to
do with confession?”</p>

<p>The Priest, who was a man as liberal as might
be, consistent with his office, informed the Colonel
that by a late law, no marriage could be celebrated
in France between Catholics, unless the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
parties had first obtained a certificate of confession;
but gave him to understand that he would
make it easy to him.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien!</i>&mdash;very well, very well,” said the Colonel;
“but what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“Very little, very little. Merely sit down, and
tell me what sins you have committed in your
life-time.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</i>” replied the Colonel; “How am I
to do that? I don’t know that I ever did any
great harm.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” returned the Priest, “merely
speak to the best of your recollection.”</p>

<p>Here he gave the Colonel his benediction.</p>

<p>“I never injured any one in my life&mdash;except,
perhaps, running a few dozen Prussians and
Spaniards through the body.&mdash;I have killed a few
Englishmen too.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce n’est rien!</i> that’s nothing.”</p>

<p>“I assisted in pillaging several towns, and
burnt one or two villages.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce n’est rien!</i> that’s nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“I have sometimes had an affair with the
ladies.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh, pour cela, ce n’est rien&mdash;ce n’est rien!</i> All
in the way of your profession. Did you ever kill
a priest?”</p>

<p>“No!&mdash;I&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;don’t think I ever <i>killed</i>
one.”</p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;very well! Did you ever assault
a nun?”</p>

<p>“O never,&mdash;no necessity! Always found the
nuns very agreeable women.”</p>

<p>“You never robbed a church, Colonel?”</p>

<p>“We melted down the golden candlesticks, and
removed a few of the pictures; but this was by
our General’s orders.”</p>

<p>“You did not rob anybody?”</p>

<p>“Never&mdash;except the Spaniards and Portuguese.&mdash;O&mdash;yes,
we did a little amongst the Prussians.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that was, as I said before, merely in
the way of your profession. Very good&mdash;very
good, Colonel, I think that will do. Now I will
give you absolution, and your certificate of purity.”</p>

<p>The Colonel received the paper, and was about
to depart, when the Priest informed him that
there was something more to be done:&mdash;A small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
fee was necessary. The Colonel cheerfully put his
hand in his pocket, and presented the clergyman
with two Napoleons, one of which his reverence
returned, observing that he was amply remunerated
for his trouble by the other. “Yet,” said he, “there
is something more to be done: you must have a
mass celebrated, to complete the marriage and
render it legal.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</i> mass!” exclaimed the Colonel,
“what is the use of mass to me?”</p>

<p>He was again told that it was necessary, and he
agreed to have it performed; “But,” said he,
“what is the expense?”</p>

<p>“You can have it done in a superior manner&mdash;full
high-mass&mdash;for two hundred francs.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, mon Dieu!</i> two hundred francs! what!&mdash;for
a mass?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, Colonel, you can have it done so low
as ten francs.”</p>

<p>“Can I?” said the Colonel, “and is the ten
franc-mass equally good in point of law, with that
for two hundred?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Colonel; but not so respectable.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacre!</i> never mind the respectability of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
matter; I’l have ten francs worth of mass&mdash;that
will do for me.”</p>

<p>The marriage was accordingly celebrated next
day in due form, the Colonel having purchased the
confessor’s certificate and ten francs worth of mass;
and he solemnly declared, on the day after his
wedding, that he could not have felt more happy,
even if he had purchased the highest priced mass
in France.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>

SMALL DIFFERENCE IN RIGHT TO QUARTERS.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My consequence&mdash;my consequence&mdash;my consequence!<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Munden</span>’s <i>Sir Anthony Absolute</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A certain little gentleman attached to the
army of Lord Wellington, while on the march
in Portugal, once took up his quarters in the best
house he could find, and having seen his horses
well put up in the rear of it, retired to the best
apartment to indulge himself in a cup of coffee;
which luxury, with many others, he was, from the
nature of his situation, enabled to carry with
him, while others, his superiors, were obliged to
put up with what they could procure <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Scarcely had his <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">rapaz</i> drawn off his boots and
re-covered his feet with slippers, when it was announced
to him, that an officer was below examining
the stables, and had ordered his horses to be
put up in them&mdash;that the officer’s baggage was
already unloading at the door of the house&mdash;and
that the officer himself had selected the quarters
in preference to any other in the village.</p>

<p>The slippered possessor, in all the consequence
of his <i>grade</i>, immediately determined that no man
should turn him out of his quarters, unless he
could establish fully a claim to a rank superior to
his own&mdash;and that too pretty clearly; in which resolution
he began to stride across the chamber
with becoming dignity. At this moment the officer
in question entered the apartment, and proceeded
to inspect its conveniencies without observing
the occupier, who with three formidable strides
approached the intruder, and demanded what he
wanted: which question was answered by the officer’s
saying, that he wished to have the quarters
in which he then stood.</p>

<p>“You shall <i>not</i> have them, Sir,” replied the
little gentleman; (he was about four feet four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
inches in height; but a very respectable and dapper
member of the army.) “You shall not have
them, Sir&mdash;I am determined on that.”</p>

<p>“Pray Sir,” demanded the stranger with astonishment,
“may I be permitted to inquire what
is your <i>rank</i> in the army?”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> rank, Sir,” replied the little disputant,
considerably irritated; “<i>my</i> rank, Sir!”&mdash;At this
moment he put his two hands into his side pockets
in a style that perfectly astonished the listener&mdash;“I
am, Sir&mdash;since you must know my rank&mdash;I am,
Sir, <span class="smcap">Mr. Lewis, Apothecary to the Forces</span>!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” replied the stranger, “that rank, I
presume, in taking quarters is equivalent to a
Lieutenant’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir, it is, Sir,” rejoined the Apothecary
to the Forces; “and now, Sir, let me ask you,
Sir, what is <i>your</i> rank, Sir?”</p>

<p>“The only difference between our respective
ranks is this,” said the stranger, “that you are
Apothecary to the Forces;&mdash;I am <i>Commander-in-Chief</i>
of the same forces; and now, Sir, I order
you, to be out of these quarters in half an hour!”</p>

<p>The tiny gentleman stared; and with the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
polite and submissive bow, (when he had recovered
from the consternation into which the explanation
had thrown him,) pulled out his watch and
said, “<i>Half an hour?</i> your lordship&mdash;<i>half an
hour?</i> that’s very short notice indeed:&mdash;say <i>thirty-five</i>
minutes, and it shall be done.”</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief nodded assent, and
laughing heartily, left the little gentleman to take
<i>his own time</i> in removing.

<p>That “<i>a cobler should stick to his last</i>,” is a
homely old saying, of infinite worth, were men to
act upon the spirit which it inculcates; but, unfortunately,
like many other wholesome things, it is too
often rejected as unpalatable, if not neglected altogether.
The danger of the infraction of this maxim,
however, has been proved by men of every grade,
from the highest to the lowest&mdash;from Cobler Buonaparte
down to Cobler Cobbett&mdash;the one marched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
to Russia, and lost the world by it; the other
trudged to Windsor, and gained but a laugh for
his pains. Ambition is at the bottom of all this:
that passion which killed alike the Roman Cato
and the London Daw. The one slew himself that
he might not witness his rival’s success; the other
died of grief because he could not bear to see his
<i>walk</i> upon the stage usurped by an understrapper.
Poor Daw had played for many years the fore leg
of the elephant in Blue Beard with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>&mdash;he was
the <i>original</i> leg; and it broke his heart to find
himself thrown into the background, by being
obliged to take the <i>hind</i>,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> instead of his foremost
character. But this is a digression; let us return
to our adage&mdash;“A cobler should stick to his last,”
and proceed to an illustration of it in an affair
which happened at Lisbon, in 1813.</p>

<p>A Commissariat clerk was on duty in that city
at this period, who possessed a handsome wife.
With his pay and allowances, amounting to about
180<i>l.</i> a-year, he managed to live very comfortably,
enjoying the society of his brethren, and appearing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
in every respect, a gentleman. But, unfortunately
for him, the British Ambassador, then at Lisbon,
(Lord Charles Stuart,) according to custom, gave
periodical balls; and what was still more unfortunate,
these balls were open to every respectable
member of the army who might choose to attend.
Of this privilege the wife of the gentleman in
question determined to avail herself, and prevailed
on her husband to accompany her. Whether it
required much persuasion to accomplish the consent
of the latter, is not known; but certain it is,
that they both attended the balls, and “turned
out” in a style that would not have disgraced a
Commissary-general. Besides the expensive circle
of acquaintance into which this attendance at the
Ambassador’s balls must necessarily have led a
<i>married</i> man, another and greater evil soon and
clearly manifested itself. The Hussar brigade had
then just arrived at Lisbon, splendidly equipped;
and, of course, its members figured as the <i>lions</i> of
the ball-room. Amongst them was a noble Marquis,
a Captain, of elegant and insinuating manners,
and remarkable for his gallantry in the field&mdash;of
Venus; for he had not yet essayed in that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
<i>Mars</i>,&mdash;and with the Commissariat gentleman’s
wife the noble Captain danced. Without entering
into a philosophical examination of the characters
of women in general, let us assume, that
few ladies, who know how to properly esteem the
pleasures of dancing in public, could well have resisted
the claims to admiration which a handsome
Hussar, decorated with a title, and a pair of scarlet
trowsers, all laced with gold, must have brought to
his aid. The heroine of this page proved her taste,
and admired the Marquis, as every lady possessing
her susceptibility and her notions of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</i>,
must have done. It is natural to look favourably
upon those who admire us. Admiration possesses
extraordinary procreative powers,&mdash;it even reproduces
itself. The Marquis and the Commissariat
clerk’s wife became, on the first night of their
dancing together, familiar acquaintances; nay, before
the ball broke up, they were found to be <i>bona
fide</i> relations&mdash;absolute cousins-German, by the
mother’s side! There is no doubt&mdash;they <i>were</i>
cousins: the Marquis first traced the consanguinity,
the lady was delighted at the discovery, and
the credulous husband <i>believed it</i>! Many garrulous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
people, however, attempted to prove, that
this cousinship was only got up, to <i>cozen</i> the
Commissary, between the noble dancer and the
sympathetic <i>danseuse</i>.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Be that as it may, both
husband and wife felt highly honoured, as we have
said, by the discovery; and the former invited
the Marquis, most pressingly, to his quarters.</p>

<p>The noble relation became a frequent visitor,
and the Commissary spoke of his “<i>Cousin, the
Marquis</i>,” to all his acquaintances with exultation;
nor was the lady backward in her civilities, for she
entertained her guest at dinner&mdash;at tea&mdash;at supper&mdash;at
all things, and at all times, within her
power, in such a way, that the <i>cousins</i> were scarcely
ever out of each other’s society.</p>

<p>In about three weeks after the cousinship commenced,
the Hussars were ordered up the country,
to join the main body of the army, and the Marquis
remained a few days behind, for the purpose
of&mdash;what? Why, of making suitable arrangements
to carry his fair <i>cousin</i> with him to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
regiment, and away from the husband who had
behaved so hospitably towards <i>him</i>, and so indulgently
to <i>her</i>!</p>

<p>The Marquis took her off to Santarem, where
his regiment lay; but, to the everlasting credit of
that regiment, (which, by the by, has been so roughly,
and perhaps unjustly, handled by public opinion)
the Marquis was not permitted to join; for
the facts of the <i>cozening</i> had galloped faster than
the noble Captain’s horses, and the officers set their
faces against the affair. He was obliged to return
to Lisbon, with the companion of his trip; when,
after some fruitless endeavours to reconcile the disunited
couple, he sent the lady to England, and
thus patched up the honour of his name with his
regiment.</p>

<p>The unhappy husband at first took the matter
to heart; but soon overcame his feelings, and
learned to despise both the wretched woman and
her paramour.</p>

<p>It is but fair to mention, however, that the
Marquis was not so <i>much</i> to blame as the lady in
this transaction: he laid no siege for years, nor
even months, before the citadel&mdash;capitulation almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
came with the summons&mdash;the vanity of the
woman was touched, and the spell awakened all
her evil passions. Her husband was a man of
good sense, (although in this instance he went “<i>beyond
his last</i>;”) he possessed a good person, agreeable
manners, and an affectionate and sincere
heart; yet this wife left him for an acquaintance
of an hour! Blame is always readier to fall upon
the <i>man</i> than on the woman in affairs of this kind,
and often very unjustly,&mdash;in this case decidedly
so; for although the Marquis acted foolishly and
rashly, in <i>taking the wife away</i>; yet the woman
was not worth a thought who could be thus won.
However, the only real sufferer, at present, is the
unfortunate wife.

<p>Love is never so happy&mdash;so gay&mdash;so delightful&mdash;so
fascinating, as when he decorates himself
in military trappings; and had his little godship
been consulted upon how his portrait ought to
have been set forth by the poets and the artists,
I have no doubt but he would have directed them
to have pictured him in the dress of a soldier.
He always has delighted in camps and barracks;
the clashing of arms sets his heart into a glow,
and the sound of the drum makes him flutter his
wings like a rising lark. Yet, with all this preference
for the profession of the sword, his happiness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
is seldom long-lived, and he is often&mdash;very often,
found weeping over his broken joys&mdash;or toys, as
they may be&mdash;in bitterness, as proportionately
poignant as his pleasures were vivid. For the
truth of this, I appeal to the individuals of the
British army who have served with the little
deity, and to those who are still better judges&mdash;their
sweethearts.</p>

<p>Amongst the many instances of romantic and
unfortunate love which have fallen under my observation
in the service, is the case of a friend of
mine&mdash;a young officer of the **th regiment of
infantry&mdash;to which are attached circumstances so
interesting, that I feel I shall not be intruding on
my readers in sketching a brief history of its
light and shade.</p>

<p>Without giving the real names of the parties,
in doing which I should not feel myself warranted,
I will tell the story; and it will not, I hope, lose
its title to credence, by romantic substitutes. Let
us then call one Allemar, and the other Ellen.</p>

<p>Allemar was about four-and-twenty when he
first saw Ellen: she was not then quite sixteen;
and although not altogether the “<i>angelic</i>” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
“<i>etherial</i>” beauty which he imagined her to be,
and as which his passionate language was wont
to speak of her, yet was she a sweet girl&mdash;such a
girl as one, possessing her, would not be inclined
to change for another, although a thousand beauties
were given him for choice:&mdash;yellow-silky hair&mdash;fine
expressive blue eyes&mdash;teeth like ivory&mdash;middle
size&mdash;shape like Venus herself:&mdash;gentle,
yet acute in thought; and as musical in her soul
as the spheres are said to be in their bodies. <i>He</i>
was a manly, open-hearted&mdash;and, what his companions
called&mdash;a good-looking fellow; but the ladies
of his acquaintance (and the ladies are the best
judges in the world of such matters) all agreed
that he was irresistible amongst them&mdash;whether
from his manliness of person, his elegance of mind,
or his suavity of manners; or whether from the
happy combination of these three qualifications,
I am not prepared to say&mdash;but certain it is that he
was “the man for the ladies.”</p>

<p>When first he marched into the town of *****
in his light-infantry dress, on the flank of his
company, the band merrily playing, and the sun
brightly glistening on his accoutrements, <i>I ween</i>&mdash;as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
bards say&mdash;he disturbed many a quiet heart,
and kept many bright eyes from sleeping so
well as they before had been accustomed to do.
The regiment was covered with white dust, and
the summer’s sun gave the countenances of the
men a fresh and ruddy appearance. When the
officers retired to the inn, and were lounging at its
parlour windows, out of the many beautiful females
who passed and repassed, (for ladies have always
a deal of out-door work to do&mdash;such as visiting,
shopping, &amp;c.&mdash;on the day a new regiment marches
into a town,) few did not look kindly on my
friend Allemar. I witnessed their glances, and, to
do the dear angelic beings justice, they expressed
their meaning in the most mistressly manner.</p>

<p>However, Ellen was not amongst them; nor did
Allemar meet with her until two months after his
arrival at ****. He was, however, not unknown
to <i>her</i>, although she was completely so to him:
she seldom passed a day without seeing him, and
with each sight increased her disposition to see
him again. At length, they were introduced to
each other at the house of a mutual acquaintance;
and from that hour they were never happy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
asunder. Their opportunities of meeting were,
at first, not very frequent, owing to the prudent
vigilance of her widowed mother and a dragon of
an old maiden relation, who had little else to do
but attend to Ellen’s morals: however, Allemar
was fortunate enough to attract the kind notice
of this antique virgin, and therefore found his
opportunities of conversing with his beloved increase.
I have often been present when they met
during a rural walk, and from what I witnessed
in the ancient lady’s manner towards my friend,
I have no doubt that she regarded him with a
tenderness wholly incompatible with their relative
ages. And so changed, too, in her general demeanour!&mdash;From
a stiff, cold, sour, puritanical
Duenna, she, all on a sudden, was transformed
into a giggling, foolish, taudry-dressed flirt. Instead
of an umbrella she now carried a yellow
parasol; and although seldom without clogs of a
moist day before, now ambled in blue-satin shoes.
Her conversation, too, was now on the beautiful
tints of the clouds&mdash;the varieties and fragrance of
the flowers&mdash;illustrating her opinions by quotations
from Darwin’s “Loves of the Plants.” She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
would sigh as she spoke to Allemar of the happiness
of true friendship, and the sweets of retirement
with those “we <i>esteemed</i>!”&mdash;There is no
doubt of it&mdash;she <i>was</i> in love with him, and this
love was very nigh proving the means of depriving
poor Allemar of his Ellen for ever; for when
she found that her hints, and her sighs, and her
languishes, were all thrown away upon him, and
that he was not only the lover, but the beloved
of her beautiful relation, she turned out the most
terrible of all she dragons that ever opened a
mouth. But enough of her, let her go to the&mdash;the
place to which all superannuated maids must
go at last:&mdash;she has nothing more to do with my
story&mdash;so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieu</i>!</p>

<p>Allemar and Ellen met, and met again;&mdash;they
walked together by the moonlight, and parted
often as the day peeped over them&mdash;they loved
truly, passionately, virtuously:&mdash;they seemed made
for each other; and to have divided such would
have been the scathing of all that is divine in
love&mdash;the destruction of all that such lovers
value more than existence itself.</p>

<p>However, they were obliged to separate; but
not without a hope of meeting again. Allemar’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
regiment was ordered to march for Portugal; and
as Ellen’s friends were not disposed to let her
marry at that time&mdash;even had Allemar received the
consent of his&mdash;it was agreed upon between the
lovers, that they should wait a more favourable
opportunity of uniting in matrimony: at the same
time, pledging each other to eternal faith in love.</p>

<p>It was in May the regiment received the route;
and Allemar passed the night previous to marching
in sweet converse with his beloved Ellen. What
a romantic night! Let the reasoner say what he
will&mdash;let the philosopher prate with his cold tongue&mdash;there
is nothing of more real worth to the heart
than the sweets of early love;&mdash;and the hour of
parting between two true and virtuous lovers is a
melancholy pleasure, perhaps equalling in tender
delight their happiest meeting. It was a beautiful
night&mdash;there was not a breath of wind; and the
moon, shining brightly down, threw a fairy light
over the whole scene.</p>

<p>On this night, as the clock struck twelve, the
enthusiastic and romantic Allemar stood under
Ellen’s window, in the orchard which was beneath
it, and with his enchanting voice, accompanied
by an old harper&mdash;such as we read of in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
romance&mdash;and a “<i>second</i>” from me, serenaded
his Beloved. The harp was a small one, but well-toned;&mdash;the
harper was a fine bass singer&mdash;a
man whose pupil in music Allemar was&mdash;and I,
although but an indifferent vocalist, made up the
trio. The scene&mdash;the time&mdash;the music&mdash;the circumstance
of parting&mdash;all conspired to impress
me with an idea of a romantic dream, the memory
of which can never leave me. These are
the words of the</p>

<p>The regiment marched at sunrise; and my
friend with it. He went to Portugal, but returned
at the end of the year on sick leave (<i>love</i>-sick
leave, no doubt), and was happily married to
his Ellen. They lived together for six months;
when Allemar was obliged to join his regiment,
then stationed before Bayonne; and as every body
expected an immediate peace, the friends of Ellen
wished her to remain at home, hoping that when
the war was at an end, her husband’s regiment
would be ordered back to England. However,
when Allemar had been but a month gone, the
mother of Ellen died. As soon as her feelings for
the loss of her beloved parent had subsided into
calm, she determined to proceed to join her husband&mdash;the
only being now in whose society she
could be happy. For this purpose, she wrote to
him, and having arranged every thing for her
departure, she, and a female servant, were provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
with a passage on board a commodious
transport for St. Jean De Luz, and sailed with a
fair wind for the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>The letter she wrote to apprize her husband of
her intention, breathed for him the most passionate
affection; and it was certainly not thrown
away upon Allemar: his love for her was, if possible,
greater than hers for him. He was like a
moping hypochondriac at Bayonne, before he received
this letter; but immediately on its receipt,
became the most lively, spirited, and pleasant officer
in the corps. He and I have often walked
along the beach, looking out for the expected ship
and the scenes of happiness which he anticipated
formed the subject generally of our conversation&mdash;he
talked of going on half-pay if peace should
take place, and to live a rural life&mdash;then he would
describe, in glowing terms, the happiness of contentment
and retirement, in comparison with the
ambition, toil, and peril, of a soldier’s life. These
and such were the dreams of fancy, in which we
used to indulge, when wandering by the sea-side.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after he had received the
letter announcing his wife’s resolution to join him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the weather became very stormy; and one morning,
after breakfast, Allemar came to me with an expression
of anxiety in his face, which he could not
disguise: he seemed cold, and was endeavouring
to check, by internal efforts, a certain trembling
which was evident all over his frame. I asked
him what was the matter. He replied, that a
fleet of transports were in sight, and as it blew so
violently, great fear was entertained by the pilots,
with whom he had spoken, that many of them
would be driven on shore; for in such weather,
to make the port was impossible. I saw how
things were, but I consoled my friend as much as
I possibly could, by seeming to laugh at the idea
of such danger.</p>

<p>We hastened down to the beach, and there
joined a group of navy officers, French pilots,
fishermen, &amp;c., whose remarks upon the vessels in
the offing were such as to give rise to the most
serious apprehensions in me for the safety of my
friend’s wife, should she be so unfortunate as to
have come on board one of the ships then struggling
with an increasing tempest on a lee-shore.
I pitied my friend from my heart, when I looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
at his face and saw the workings of his feelings
there so strongly depicted.</p>

<p>He would not move from the beach the whole
day, except occasionally to make inquiries in the
town of St. Jean de Luz, as to the means of assistance
to be rendered the vessels in case of necessity.
By his field-glass he often fancied he saw the
letters which marked the transport in which his
Ellen sailed, and was as often set right by me. The
vessel in which she took her passage, was marked
A. Z. T., in letters of two feet in length; and the
glass nearly dropped from my hand, when I perceived
the identical letters on the quarter of a brig
which had been all the morning nearly out of
sight, but now approached the land. I could not
tell my friend of what I saw; but he too soon
confirmed my discovery, and clasping his hands in
the most intense agony of mind, cried out, “It
<i>is</i> the ship&mdash;O God, protect her!”</p>

<p>We hastened to the port, where my friend, half
distracted, called on the boatmen to go out; but
the answer was, that they did not think any of the
ships would go aground; and also that the sea was
too rough for boats. However, by the means of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
gold, he persuaded a couple of hardy and brave
French fishermen to attempt the assistance of the
ship, in which he believed his wife then to be. The
boat in which they were to put off for the transport
was as large as the Deal boats, and with Deal
smugglers on board, might “live” through any
sea: great hopes, therefore, were entertained that
the fisherman would be successful.</p>

<p>My friend insisted on going along with them,
and when he was about to step into the boat he
handed me his keys; then shaking me heartily by
the hand, gave me to understand what he dared
not speak&mdash;nor, indeed, could I have heard&mdash;without
exhibiting a woman’s weakness. As it was,
we were not far from it&mdash;a word would have unmanned
us.</p>

<p>The boat bounded away from the harbour over
the high surges, shaping her course well for her
object; and considering that she had to beat to
windward, she made wonderful progress: however,
it was four o’clock ere she got within half
a mile of the vessel. The tempest was now increasing
frightfully&mdash;the worn out transports
seemed as if they were giving up the ghost to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
the overwhelming storm&mdash;none carried more canvass
than topsails close reefed, and the opinion of
every one on the beach was, that all would be
wrecked if the weather did not change. It was
getting dark: I saw the boat labouring amidst
the hills of foaming water, and the ship was
within hail of her. It darkened:&mdash;we could see
no more of either boat or ships; and could only
ascertain what direction they were in by the
flashes of the occasional guns of distress which
some of them fired. It was a sickening sight.
I knew not what to do:&mdash;I <i>could</i> do nothing&mdash;except,
indeed, offer up my prayers for the
safety of the poor souls that were hurling over
the frightful abyss of horrors.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Guns were repeated and repeated; but no
assistance could those on shore render the ships.
I was bewildered;&mdash;I wandered home&mdash;back again&mdash;lay
down&mdash;arose restless&mdash;watched the daylight;
and then was the horrid reality:&mdash;the ship
had gone to pieces; so had the boat&mdash;my dear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
friend, and all his dream of happiness, gone! Not
a being either in the ship or boat was saved, and
the bodies of Allemar and Ellen were washed
on shore about a mile below St. Jean de Luz.</p>

<p>This catastrophe has since caused me many
painful reflections. The manner in which the
lovers met and died in the tempest, was before my
eyes night and day for a long time after it happened:
indulging in these melancholy thoughts,
I drew the following imaginative picture of their
fate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Along by the sea-cliff as Allemar hied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To wear the sad moments away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sorrow he view’d the increase of the tide,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">“My Ellen&mdash;ah! why dost thou stay?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three sunsetting hours did he visit the shore,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<p>To those officers who happened to have been on
sick leave at Belem, near Lisbon, in 1810 and 11,
General P****** must “of a verity” be well
known: few, indeed, could have sojourned many
days in that invalid retirement, without having
observed the stooped shoulder, topped by the
shallow cocked-hat, and covered with the eternal
blue frock-coat, stealing along close to the wall
upon a tall English horse. Who of those have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
not been haunted by the said phantom, at some
time or other, if perchance in order to relax the
dreary and monotonous hours of a sick chamber,
they dared to meet on the road to enjoy a little
cheerful conversation? Terrible, indeed, was this
evening apparition&mdash;this warning spirit, who like
the death fetch came to <i>fetch</i> the sick away! No
tom cat ever paid more determined attention to
mouse-catching pastime, than did the General to
his favourite pleasure of pouncing upon the invalid
officer, who but dared to show himself out of his
melancholy quarters. He conceived that no man
could possibly be sick, who was able to move his
legs; and if a half dead officer could but smoke a
cigar, or twist the corners of his mouth into a
smile, the whole medical staff could not have
persuaded the General out of his opinion, that
such a person was not only in excellent health,
but fit to brave the rudest weather, and the severest
duties of the field.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that, even among the <i>officers</i>
of the peninsular army, there have been “<i>skulkers</i>”&mdash;men
who, in order to avoid the necessary fatigues
of a campaign, have “shammed” sickness, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
having been really ill, contrived to obtain sick leave
for a long time after they had recovered; but such
instances, highly to the credit of “the cloth,” were
very rare indeed.</p>

<p>Belem was the place appointed for sick officers,
and General P******, no doubt in his zeal for the
service, conceived that most of the residents there
were (in his own phraseology) “<i>humbugging</i>;” he
therefore, in addition to his proper duties, took
upon himself those of the staff surgeons, and left
no experiment untried for the cure of the malady
which he believed epidemically to rage at Belem,
namely, the <i>Idle Disease</i> or <i>Lazy Fever</i>. The
treatment which he principally adopted was of the
<i>stimulating</i> description; but, alas! his method of
cure obtained no favour for him in the eyes of
his patients.</p>

<p>It was common among those sick officers at Belem,
whenever any of them in their walks happened
to be so unlucky as to have met the General, to go
home and make instant preparations for joining,
whether capable of doing duty or not; for their
names were sure to be in the garrison orders of
the following day, for marching.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>This system of <i>espionnage</i> was very naturally
looked upon as cruel and insulting in the extreme;
it rouzed the indignant feelings of all the officers
against the General; but for obvious reasons they
could not resent his proceedings in any other way
than by demonstrations of contempt. One, however,
a convalescent Lieutenant, who had

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Done the state some service,”<br /></span>
</span></span>

happened to have fallen within the General’s <i>evening</i>
eye: he was, in fact, as the phrase is, <i>dogged</i>
a mile out of the town, and next day popped into
orders for “<i>joining forthwith</i>,” although still very
weak, and a man

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“&mdash;&mdash; Who never turned his back<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On duty or the foe.”<br /></span>
</span></span></p>

<p>The Lieutenant prepared to obey, and the day
previous to his departure, in riding through Lisbon,
whither he had gone to purchase some articles
necessary for his march, accompanied by a
brother officer, he met General P. in one of the
main streets, attended by his orderly dragoon&mdash;one
of the Portuguese police. The Lieutenant, on
perceiving him, allowed his friend to ride on,
while he pulled up a little, so as to come very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
slowly in front of the General. As soon as he
breasted him, he stopped&mdash;affected an animated
smile of recognition&mdash;took off his hat in a most
respectful manner&mdash;held out his hand to the
General, which was duly received; and, still
smiling, griped his fingers as fast as if they were
fixed in a vice, while he thus emphatically addressed
him:&mdash;“Sir, an officer who has served
in seven actions, and who has been thrice wounded,
has the pleasure of telling you that you are
a most <i>contemptible spy</i>, and a <i>disgrace to the
commission you hold</i>. You are fit for no command
unless it be in the police. Good morning,
<i>mouchard</i>.” The General instantly called
to the orderly dragoon;&mdash;“Listen to this officer,”
said he; “Mark him, Sir&mdash;mark his words,
Sir.” Then calling after the officer&mdash;who trotted
off bowing politely&mdash;“Come back here, Sir&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;
I say&mdash;do you hear, Sir?” he almost
gasped with passion; but the Lieutenant was
gone, and the General left with his orderly,
who looked as apathetically as the statue in St.
James’s square.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant went home, but was not permitted
to march so soon as he expected: for he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
was placed in arrest, and his conduct submitted
to the investigation of a court of inquiry, upon
charges of mutinous conduct highly unbecoming
the character of an officer and a gentleman, &amp;c.
&amp;c., preferred against him by General P******.</p>

<p>The Court was composed of the highest officers
in Lisbon, and on the awful day of inquiry, the
General minutely detailed before it, the circumstance
of which he had to complain. The Lieutenant,
with an air of the utmost confidence totally
denied the charges, and insinuated that the General
must have laboured under some aberration of
mind, or else had mistaken him for another person.
The only witness of the transaction (the Portuguese
dragoon) was called, who answered by an
interpreter. His evidence was conclusive against
the General: for, on being asked by the Court
to describe what he had seen, he said that the
Lieutenant met the General in the street&mdash;<i>took off
his hat most politely&mdash;that the parties shook hands
cordially</i>&mdash;that in a few moments they parted, the
Lieutenant <i>bowing, with his hat off, most respectfully</i>:&mdash;and
that then the General talked a good
deal to himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>“But, Sir,” demanded the complainant petulantly,
through the interpreter, “what did the
Lieutenant <i>say</i>?” To which the evidence answered
with a Portuguese shrug&mdash;“that he <i>did not understand
a word of English</i>, but that he supposed
the Lieutenant to have been <i>enquiring after the
state of the General’s health</i>!”</p>

<p>Further evidence in favour of the officer than
the prosecutor’s own witness was needless&mdash;the
Lieutenant was released from his arrest, and the
General obliged to “pocket the affront.”

<p>Cæsar was forty years of age before he fought
his first battle; or, indeed, before he could be
fairly said to have been a soldier: yet he became
one of the most able and successful generals the
Roman empire ever produced. This age in a
general is by no means out of keeping with the
wisdom and energy required to constitute a good
commander: it may be rather considered as not
sufficiently advanced, by at least from five to ten
years. But an <i>ensign</i> of forty is a thing quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
out of character&mdash;a monstrous absurdity, as the
army is now constituted; and if Cæsar himself had
had to enter the Roman army in that grade, judging
by our British scale of promotion, he never
would have arrived at a brevet-majority. An
Ensign is the boy of the colours&mdash;the page to
regimental victory, whose chin should never bear
a beard while he holds the post&mdash;a youthful soldier,&mdash;a
Mars of fifteen, with the staff of his
country’s flag fixed firmly in the earth, supporting
and supported by him, while the rough mustachioed
band like rocks surround and shield him
from the tempest of the fight. But a <i>Volunteer</i> of
forty!&mdash;Is not that an odd production? I do
not mean a “<i>City Volunteer</i>,” nor a “<i>County Volunteer</i>;”
but an individual who joins a regiment of
the line on service in the field, by permission of its
Colonel&mdash;clothes himself&mdash;and, although avowedly
for the purpose of becoming soon an Ensign&mdash;and
although received as a gentleman by the officers
of the corps he joins, is drilled in the ranks, and
fights as a private soldier. Such a man, I say,
“begins at the beginning” of his profession, and
has a tolerably long road to travel ere he obtain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
his first commission&mdash;that of Ensign. A Volunteer
of forty, then, is a ridiculous anomaly, a <i>rara
avis in exercitu</i>, and (thank Minerva!) was even
more scarce during the Peninsular war, than is a
French Eagle in “this piping time of peace.”
However, we <i>had</i> one of those odd birds, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nigroque
simillima cygno</i>, who flew out from his native hills
in Cambria to the more classic mountains of the
Pyrenees, at the very <i>latter end</i> of the very <i>last</i>
campaign which the Anglo-Lusitanian army accomplished.
Considering, then, this hero’s age,
and the time at which he joined the standard of
war, every one must allow that he did not “begin
at the beginning;” and it must appear equally evident
that he never could have become a Cæsar,
even though he had lived to the age of old Parr.</p>

<p>This military aspirant arrived at Passages a little
after the siege of San Sebastian, and I happened
to be on the verge of the quay, as the vessel
which contained him brought up:&mdash;it was a wretched-looking
schooner, and not at all engaged in the
service; but contained, in addition to the <i>Volunteer</i>,
a cargo of butter, cheese, and ready-made slops.</p>

<p>When her anchor was dropped, and the master
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
of the vessel, with his passenger, jumped on shore
beside me, I thought the latter was the former,
and the former a mate. Without hesitation I
asked them had they come from England, and
what news. The hero immediately furnished me
with an abridgement of the preceding month’s
“<cite>Times</cite>” and “<cite>Chronicle</cite>,” in such a peculiar
way, and with such familiarity, that I immediately
concluded I had caught hold of as odd a fish as
ever came from the ocean; and I should have had
no objection to examine him further, but the time
which I had to spare was expired; and as he had
concluded his <i>report</i>, I wished him good morning,
stepped into the ferry-boat, and passed to the other
side of the gut which divides the town.</p>

<p>When I had made the purchases of various
articles of provision for which I had come to Passages,
I went back to <i>Renteria</i>, the town in which
I was quartered, and which is situated about a
league from the former.</p>

<p>I had dined at home&mdash;(<i>home!</i> where is the soldier’s
home?) I had dined at my quarters at Renteria,
and had strolled along the beach, listening to
the boat-women singing as they crossed the lake of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Leso, when I saw the “new arrival” approaching
the shore in a ferry-boat.</p>

<p>“Captain, Captain!” roared he out, “how are
you <i>again</i>, Sir? I’ll be with you in a moment.”</p>

<p>Thus was I saddled with his company, rather
against my will; but as I had nothing either to amuse
or employ me at that moment, I submitted quietly,
and we walked together towards the market-place.
It was during this walk I learned that my companion
was not the master of the butter-schooner,
but a “Gentleman Volunteer,” absolutely on his
way to the head-quarters of the army. So sincerely
did he assure me of this, ridiculous as it
appeared, that I hesitated not to offer the hospitality
of my quarters, which he very readily accepted,
and we lost not a moment in proceeding to
crack a bottle; or, rather, broach a pig-skin, for
in such vessels was the wine of Renteria usually
contained.</p>

<p>We sat together for a few hours, and I found
that, in his new profession, my guest was an enthusiast
of the most capacious calibre; yet upon
other subjects rational, and sometimes acute. To
carry the matter by comparison, I will say that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
his intellect could have hit a thought, as a screw-barrelled
pocket pistol might the ace of hearts, at
ten paces, when aimed and discharged by a tolerably
good shot&mdash;he would never fly a mile from
it, but seldom if ever pop right through the centre.
A short extract from the conversation of the
evening will outline my man, far better than comment.
This I will attempt from memory. In
the dialogue, I will call him I. and myself II.&mdash;not
that there were two to one against the Volunteer
in any sense; but for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>I. Yes, Captain, I have determined to join my
gallant countrymen in their glorious cause, and
lend a hand to pull down the tyrant Buonaparte.</p>

<p>II. That is laudable, Sir; but I fear it will
not be very profitable to you.</p>

<p>I. Profitable! I don’t much care for profit,
so as I obtain well-earned promotion.</p>

<p>II. The war is now drawing to a close, and it
will be difficult to succeed in your hopes.</p>

<p>I. The war, Sir, will never end. Excuse me,
Sir&mdash;when I say never, I say only with the everlasting
Scriptures, “We shall have wars and wars
and rumours of wars.” Besides, Sir, the Russians,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
and Prussians, and Austrians, and even British,
I fear, cannot effectually overcome that scourge of
civil liberty, Napoleon.</p>

<p>II. Pardon me, Sir, I think his day is drawing
to a close.</p>

<p>I. Impossible! the hordes of the North must
vanish before him, even like the chaff before the
wind. England is the only hope.</p>

<p>II. Be that as it may: your Ensigncy will not
be very long coming, if you get it at the fall of
Buonaparte.</p>

<p>I. I would give up all my hopes to see him
fall; for in taking the crown, he betrayed the
cause that raised him to glory.</p>

<p>II. Then I suppose you say, he sold liberty
for a <i>crown</i>?</p>

<p>I. Precisely. Look at Cromwell, Sir; the man,
like David, after God’s own heart&mdash;<i>he</i> reigned
without a crown. Look at the Roman republic,
Sir&mdash;<i>that</i> was sold for a crown. Look to America&mdash;no
crowns there.</p>

<p>II. If you have such objections to crowns,
why wish to fight for them?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p>I. Indeed, Sir, I am now only&mdash;a&mdash;talking as
it were&mdash;a&mdash;on public matters. I am as loyal as
any man.</p>

<p>II. ’Pon my honour, if opinions upon such
subjects were often canvassed in the army, even by
men of half your age, they would stand but a poor
chance of promotion.</p>

<p>I. Half my age:&mdash;how old do you think I
am?</p>

<p>II. About fifty-two.</p>

<p>I. What!&mdash;Oh, you joke.</p>

<p>II. Well, how old <i>are</i> you?</p>

<p>I. I’m not yet forty.</p>

<p>II. Forty! that’s pretty well, I think, for a
Volunteer.</p>

<p>I. It is, in my mind, the proper age for every
thing which requires the full energy of the mind;
and what calls for <i>that</i> more than the art of war?
I always had a taste for the noble profession&mdash;I
have <i>taught</i> military tactics.</p>

<p>II. Taught!</p>

<p>I. Yes, Sir, taught&mdash;and some of my pupils
are now Captains in the local militia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>II. Indeed!</p>

<p>I. Yes, Sir; I led the business of one of the
first schools in England.</p>

<p>II. God bless me!</p>

<p>I. Forty! Have you read Cæsar, Sir?&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnis
Gallia divisa est in partes tres, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;<i>He</i>
was beyond that age, when his talents came
into the field. Look at Washington, Sir, that
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patriæ Columen</i>”&mdash;<i>he</i> was also beyond that age
when he took up arms. Cromwell, too&mdash;see what
a soldier he became. Pichegru, also, was at my
age before he was made an officer. And let me
tell you, Sir, that boys are <i>not</i> fit to command&mdash;give
me the man, whose sense and judgment are
matured. I don’t mind two years as Ensign;&mdash;I
get my Lieutenancy before I am forty-two: there
are now many Lieutenants older than that, Sir.&mdash;Well&mdash;I
know the use of tactics, and as to fighting&mdash;give
me an opportunity. I wish I had been
out time enough for the storming of San Sebastian!
Let me have but an opportunity&mdash;I’ll die
in the breach, or I’ll be promoted. I have entered
the temple of Mars, Sir,&mdash;I have shaken
the <i>Ancilia</i>&mdash;I have waved his sacred spear, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
I have cried “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mars, Vigilia!</i>” But, Sir, this is
my motto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el" class="i0">“ὁτι εν τῳ πολεμῳ αλλ’ εργων χρεία.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Do you understand that?</p>

<p>II. I see you are very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>I. And is there any thing to be done without it?</p>

<p>II. You are right. Come fill your glass again,
Sir.</p>

<p>I. Oh, by George! I have filled too often:
I have taken two glasses for your one; but pleasant
company, and good wine, are persuasive arguments.
Your very good health, Sir; and although
you are not three-and-twenty, and I am forty,
we shall see who will run up the hill fastest. Excuse
me&mdash;“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Palmam qui meruit ferat.</i>” Your
health, Sir.</p>

<p>II. I hope you will not be like Tantalus, in
the waters of promotion.</p>

<p>I. What!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tantalus à labris sitiens fugientia captat</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Flumina</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Give me your hand, Sir; you are a classical
scholar,&mdash;Horace,&mdash;I can see that:&mdash;I respect
you, Sir;&mdash;I re-<i>spect</i> you, Sir.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>II. What do you think of an ensign, who passed
from the age of seventeen to forty-seven without
promotion?</p>

<p>I. He must have had no education,&mdash;knew
nothing,&mdash;nothing of tactics,&mdash;nothing of the art
of war. I have made it my study; I am well
acquainted with the best schools of warfare&mdash;the
Grecian, the Roman, and the modern. Granicus,
Marathon, and Pharsalia, are familiar to me. I
have made myself acquainted with the characters
of every great conqueror, from Charles the Twelfth,
who was my favourite, down to Lord Wellington.
The Duke of Marlborough’s campaigns I have
deeply studied, and know every move in the battles
of Fredlingen, Scardigen, Schwemmingen,
Spinbach, Shellenberg, Blenheim, and Ramillies.
In short, Sir, if I do not succeed, it will be my
own fault.</p>

<p>II. With those qualifications for the military
profession, it is to be lamented that you did not
embrace it earlier in life.</p>

<p>I. If I had taken up the profession earlier, I
should not have been so well qualified. A series
of years devoted to the instruction of young gentlemen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
in&mdash;not only military science&mdash;but of general
learning, afforded me the very qualification
by which I hope to rise in the army.</p>

<p>II. Come, fill again; you are not doing any thing
at all.</p>

<p>I. Doing! Ecod, I am doing away with my
brains, and I’m half done over; but a pleasant
companion and good wine, I say again, are not to
be resisted&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solis æterna est Phœbo Bacchoque juventa.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Isn’t that right, eh?</p>

<p lang="la" xml:lang="la">II. <i>Tunc dolor et curæ</i> <small>RUGA</small><i>que frontis abit.</i></p>

<p>I. Excellent! good! fine! give me your hand.&mdash;Ovid,
Sir&mdash;good! I respect you, Sir; I reverence
you, Sir. You’ll be a general; you’ll be a great
commander, depend upon it. I’ll fill a bumper;
there, there, there! and now&mdash;here is wishing you
every success&mdash;may you be a field-marshal!</p>

<p>II. Thank you; thank you:&mdash;when I <i>am</i>, I’ll
recommend you for promotion, and do for all your
sons.</p>

<p>I. Sons! I have no sons. I may say with
the great North American Chief,&mdash;“There runs
not one drop of my blood in any living creature.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>II. But this may not be so hereafter.</p>

<p>I. That’s all over, Sir. I once approached the
steps of Hymen’s altar; but the torch of the god
was quenched: it never shall be lighted for me
again.</p>

<p>II. Ah! I suppose you were jilted?</p>

<p>I. Jilted! Sir, I was shamefully treated. I,
for three years, courted a young lady; she was
every thing to me; she personified the woman I
all my life pictured in my imagination. She was
two-and-twenty&mdash;tall&mdash;fine countenance&mdash;bold
outline of features;&mdash;danced&mdash;played;&mdash;a perfect
scholar, Sir.</p>

<p>II. Take care you don’t make such a beautiful
form now, that, like Pygmalion, you will break
your rash vow, and pray for the animated reality.</p>

<p>I. Oh, Sir; you delight me. Your classic conversation&mdash;I
am glad,&mdash;glad,&mdash;very glad of your
acquaintance.</p>

<p>II. Well, about the lady.</p>

<p>I. Ah, Sir! (<i>a deep sigh.</i>) I courted her for
nearly three years; she approved&mdash;I approved&mdash;father
and mother approved; and I had absolutely
engaged to take a house, Sir&mdash;fine, spacious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
premises, fit for an extensive sch&mdash;seminary,&mdash;ladies’
seminary; for she was the daughter of the
gentleman whose business I had conducted. Well,
Sir, we were to be married; and what do you
think?&mdash;Damn me! if she didn’t run away with a
Sergeant of the Lancers, two days previous to our
intended wedding!&mdash;Ah, Sir! (<i>deep sigh</i>) that
broke down my habits of business. I gave up
every thing connected with seminaries, or schools,
or private tuition, and applied to General Dizzyman,
for whom my father always votes: he gave
me a letter to Colonel Pepperton, and I am
now on my way to that gentleman. It produced
a shock, Sir; but the life of a soldier will, I
hope, make all things right again.</p>

<p>II. Hang all the sex!</p>

<p>I. Hang them all, I say, three times over&mdash;the
jilts&mdash;the runaway wretches!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My guest now grew melancholy: he helped himself
to more wine, and gradually fell into an unintelligible
grumble. The poor fellow had no quarter;
and as it was late, I could not think of turning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
him out, so applied to the <i>Patron</i> of my <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caza</i>
for assistance. He was a good man, and offered
a bed; so I directed my servant to lead my
guest to his repose.</p>

<p>Next morning he was gone; but at about
nine o’clock, as I was about to breakfast, he returned,
came into my room and requested me to
look out of the window at a purchase which he
had made for twenty dollars. I looked out: it
was a miserable donkey which he had that moment
bought from a Portuguese. On its back was strapped
an old saddle, with a still more veteran valise
attached to it, while a pair of boots, balanced by a
striped blue handkerchief full of sundry articles
of provision, hung across the animal’s neck. With
perfect good humour the adventurer philosophized
on the poverty of his stud and baggage, giving
me several appropriate quotations. We then sat
down, and after eating a hearty breakfast of chocolate,
eggs, and cold beef, he took his leave of
me, mounted the ass, and proceeded slowly on the
road to Irun, where the regiment to which he had
his introduction was stationed.</p>

<p>I heard no more of the Volunteer until the day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
on which our troops crossed the Bidassoa&mdash;about
three weeks after his departure from Renteria. It
was in the evening, and about a mile from Irun,
on the high road. He was walking in custody of
the Provost Marshal&mdash;had on a red <i>coatee</i>, torn
and bemudded&mdash;his head without its proper covering,
and his whole aspect that of a madman.
He recognized me in a moment, and my presence
seemed to calm the rage which burnt within him,&mdash;to
the no small delight of the Provost, who evidently
had been very much troubled in the management
of his charge. A part of the dialogue
which passed between us I will try to recollect:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i> What have you been doing?</p>

<p><i>Volunteer.</i> Doing? I have been doing thankless
work. I am disgusted with the service, Sir.
A man of mind or genius has no business in it.</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i> Bless me! what can all this mean?</p>

<p><i>Provost.</i> The gentleman has been playing the
very devil in front, Sir, and the General has
ordered me to see that he goes to the rear.</p>

<p><i>Volunteer.</i> Ay, playing the devil, Captain
Provost. I wanted to prevent <i>them</i> from playing
the devil; that stupid Colonel of mine knows no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
more of military tactics than a horse. Now mark
you, Sir&mdash;the column of subdivisions was ordered
to change its direction on a moveable pivot: “Left
shoulders forward” was given instead of “<i>right
shoulders forward</i>,” and I of course&mdash;thinking for
the best&mdash;cried out to the Captain of the company
I belonged to, that he was wrong; when he ordered
me out of the ranks. I wouldn’t be treated so;
therefore went up to the Colonel to speak with
him on the subject, when the French began to fire
grape shot in amongst us. The regiment halted
before crossing the river, while the shot was
coming thicker and thicker; so I was determined
to tell my mind&mdash;for a good commanding officer
would have moved his men a little under cover,&mdash;and
I called out to the Colonel to advance, or to
move by an <i>oblique echelon</i> to the left, in order
to get the men under a high bank. What d’ye
think, Sir?&mdash;he said he’d order me to be flogged
if I did not immediately go to the rear! The
column at this moment received a shower of shot
which knocked some down; so, in the confusion of
eight or ten of the men near the river, I was thrown
off the bank&mdash;souse in the water, and was carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
down luckily to the ford, or I should have been lost.
I scrambled out&mdash;look how wet I am&mdash;and went
back to the regiment, when the Colonel sent me
to be flogged by the Provost: and if the General,
God bless him! had not fortunately been riding
by, I should have been disgracefully punished;
but he asked what the matter was, and then sent
me to the rear in charge of this gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i> Really, I think you acted very imprudently
by interfering with the command.</p>

<p><i>Provost.</i> Lord bless you, Sir; he threw the men
into the greatest ferment and confusion.</p>

<p><i>Volunteer.</i> I’ll tell you, Sir, that they are all
ignorant fellows&mdash;all, Sir. I did every thing for
the best, and this is the way I was treated: the
fact of the matter is, the service is disgusting, and
I will immediately return to England.</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i> Where is your cap?</p>

<p><i>Volunteer.</i> It was shot off my head a little before
I was thrown into the Bidassoa.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now prepared to part from my quondam acquaintance,
for the day was advancing, and I had
yet two leagues to go; so I recommended him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
to call at my late quarters at Renteria, where he
would be hospitably received by the owner of the
house: he thanked me, and relaxing into a smile
as he nearly squeezed my hand off, he emphatically
exclaimed, “I have this, at least, to consolate
me:&mdash;I have stood the fire of the foe, and swam in
the stream that waters Fontarabia: with the poet
I may exclaim.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Thus we parted, and resumed our opposite
marches&mdash;I for the front, and the volunteer, with
his escort, for Renteria.

<p>On a cold and snowy night, in the winter of
1823, I was passing through the Strand, on my
way home from a formal dinner-party, when I
stepped into one of those houses of entertainment
which abound in that semi-fashionable neighbourhood
which skirts the occidental line of aristocratic
demarcation&mdash;Charing Cross. Although this house
had assumed the dignified appellation of <i>tavern</i>,
the only claim it possessed to such distinction,
was the display of a few mutton-chops, a plate
of mutton kidneys, and two fine heads of celery,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
in the window. Nor was it what is termed “a
<i>public-house</i>”&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Where ’bacco-pipes, and clumsy pots of beer<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Regale the crowd:”<br /></span>
</span></span>

but might be said to have fixed its intrinsic rank
midway between the two. It possessed a neat and
comfortable parlour for public use, and, although
perfumed by tobacco, and moistened by homely
ale, neither vulgar “pipe” nor clumsy “pot” disgraced
it&mdash;the segar, in its “naked beauty,” and
the brightly polished pewter-vessel, there repelled
the rabble, and imparted their cheering pleasures
to respectable visitors. The evening paper was
there&mdash;and so was the “<cite>Times</cite>,” to read both of
which, as well as to escape a heavy fall of snow, I
opened the parlour-door, took a seat at an agreeable
distance from a fine blazing fire, and was soon
accommodated with the newspaper, together with
a cup of smoking-hot brandy and water.</p>

<p>There were five persons in the parlour, each at a
separate table, but all conversing freely together
on that never-ending and purely English topic&mdash;the
weather. One of them, however, but seldom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
spoke, and then it was when addressed by others
of the company: he seemed by his air, and the
formation of a threadbare and well-brushed blue
frock coat, to belong to the army, and I at once
set him down as one of “the cloth.”</p>

<p>“Waiter, give me a Welsh-rabbit,” said this
gentleman, in a mild voice to the attendant
of the room, and then took up the newspaper,
which he continued to peruse until his supper was
brought in.</p>

<p>While he was reading, I had an opportunity of
observing him closely: he was bald, except on the
sides of the head, and there the thin hair was grey:
his face was thin, his cheeks rather hollow, and
his large and expressive eyes overshadowed by
strongly marked brows: his figure was tall, but
wasted; and from the oppressed and hurried way
in which he breathed, it was evident that his health
was broken. The whole of his dress was extremely
clean, but almost worn out. I could perceive
that his boots, on which the strong blaze of the
fire fell, were in no state to guard the invalid who
wore them from the dangerous effects of the melting
snow, over which he must tread on his return
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
home. When I thought of this, and considered
that it might cause his death, or at least encrease
his illness, I sincerely pitied his situation. I felt
as if I had already learnt his history, and beheld
in him the ruins of a genuine military gentleman.</p>

<p>On addressing my conversation occasionally to
him, I found that he was by no means so reserved
as at first I imagined; and in a short time we
fell into a lively and an interesting chat. I politely
asked him if he would take a little brandy
and water; but he excused himself, although
pressed, by saying that his health would not permit
him to drink more than half a pint of porter:
this, he said, he took usually in the evening.
“Wine,” said he, “is too expensive in London,
or I should certainly prefer it.” I immediately
requested the waiter to bring some wine; but of
this the gentleman also refused to partake&mdash;and in
such a manner that I felt I should have wounded
his feelings by pressing my request farther.</p>

<p>We were now undisturbed by general observations;
for when the others in the room perceived
we were not at all disposed to join them in chat,
they continued to discuss the topics of the day without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
interrupting us. We conversed for about two
hours, and I was never more delighted than by
his conversation. Military affairs was the subject:
we had both served in the Peninsula, and consequently
talked of many mutual acquaintances,
living and dead: this made us so far familiar, that
he gave me an outline of his professional life.</p>

<p>He had entered the army as ensign in 1790,
and had served in both the East and West Indies,
Holland, and the Peninsula&mdash;obtained his
Lieutenancy by chance, and his company by
purchase. At the close of the last war he was
placed on half-pay; in which state he remained:
nor could he succeed in obtaining a return to full
pay, notwithstanding his long services: this, however,
was owing to the great reductions made in the
army after the war. He was a native of Bath,&mdash;the
son of a clergyman whose interest in the church
was considerable at the time he became an Ensign;
and he assured me, that had he taken his father’s
advice and embraced the profession of the church
instead of the army he would have been a rich
man&mdash;not a poor pensioner with a ruined constitution,
and without hopes of better days in this world:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
“But,” said he, “I was fond of gaiety&mdash;the fine
uniform of the army caught my young mind, and
pleased a beautiful and interesting young lady
whom I afterwards married; so I gave up the
reality for the shadow:” these were his expressions.
His wife died in the West Indies, and left him
two daughters: they grew up: both married
officers in the army: one went to Sierra Leone
and died: the other went to Madras; but whether
alive or dead he did not know, not having heard
from her for eleven months. All his relations were
extinct. “I returned,” said he, “from Waterloo,
where I was slightly wounded, and on going
down to Bath met my father’s funeral&mdash;the
only relation I had had then on earth except my
daughter, who is in India.” He was placed on
half-pay, by the reduction of the battalion in
which he was effective. He possessed about four
hundred pounds in cash; and this, with his income
of seven shillings per day, promised fairly to place
him above necessity. He remained in London perhaps
more from a wish to be on the spot with the
head-quarter people, than from any preference he
had to an overgrown, noisy, expensive, metropolis;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
where, without wealth or friends, life is solitude
of the worst description. He thought he possessed
a better chance of being re-employed in the
service, and so obtain a majority by staying near
the Commander-in-chief, to watch the progress
of military affairs. But year passed after year,
in the same dull expectation, and he found
himself as far removed from his hopes in 1823 as
he was in 1817. His four hundred pounds he
lodged in the hands of a mock army agent, who,
from day to day, and month to month, promised
him an exchange with some individual, with
whom, perhaps, the impostor never had communicated.
This mock agent at length failed, and ran
away; leaving the poor Captain with nothing but
his seven shillings a-day: and not only did he take
with him his client’s four hundred pounds, but
his last quarter’s half-pay, which the knave drew the
day before he departed.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>This took place about six weeks before the evening
I met the Captain. I immediately offered to
introduce him to an army agent, who would advance
him the amount of his following quarter’s
half-pay. This offer he not only willingly accepted,
but cordially thanked me for it; indeed, it
had the greatest effect upon his spirits&mdash;he became
quite another man&mdash;his countenance lost much of
its melancholy; and it appeared he had previously
much reason to be depressed; for he frankly
informed me, that Greenwood’s had refused to advance
money, and therefore, for the last six weeks,
he had been obliged to have recourse to raising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
money by pawning his clothes. I hesitated not a
moment in offering him the loan of what change
I then had in my pocket, but he declined to take
it; nor could I press him to the acceptance of it.
He thanked me gratefully, and promised to meet
me at the house we were then in, on the following
day at two o’clock, for the purpose of going together
to the agent. He paid for his welsh-rabbit
and his half-pint of porter, cordially shook hands
with me, and we parted. Poor fellow! as he
feebly walked out into the fast falling snow, so
thinly clad, I heartily wished that Heaven had
thrown a cloak over his shoulders.</p>

<p>I was true to my appointment next day; but the
Captain was not. I waited an hour, and then left
word for him with the waiter that I would come in
the evening&mdash;and would remain until ten o’clock. I
could not think what was the reason of the officer
not meeting me, when it was upon a matter of
so much importance to him. I went at night,
according to what I told the waiter, but he was
not there. I called next night,&mdash;he was not there.
I now concluded that sickness, or perhaps death,
was the cause; and regretted much that I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
neither left with him my address, nor the name of
the agent to whom I promised to introduce him;
neither had I got his card,&mdash;certain of meeting
at the appointed time and place, we both overlooked
the necessity of interchanging addresses.</p>

<p>What I am now about to describe, my readers
will say is more of the romantic than the real: I
must confess it looks more like the imaginative
occurrence of a novel, than of actual life; but, at
the same time, can assure them, that it is not
romance&mdash;not imagination,&mdash;but fact.</p>

<p>Three weeks had passed away, and I had totally
given up the idea of meeting again this unfortunate
gentleman. I had frequently gone to the
house where we had met, but without finding
him. I left my address with the waiter, to deliver,
should he see him; but my card was never
removed from the rack in the bar, where the waiter
had placed it.</p>

<p>It happened at this time that I changed my
lodgings to Villiers-street, Strand. Here I engaged
a tolerably well-furnished pair of parlours, and
was reading at my fire, the second night after I
took possession of them, when my landlord&mdash;a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
fat clerk to a brewer&mdash;opened the hall-door for
somebody who had knocked. I heard his voice
increasing to a pitch of anger, which awakened my
curiosity; so I laid down my book and listened.</p>

<p>“You cannot be taking up my room for nothing,
in this way, Sir; I must pay my rent, and
I <i>shall</i> be paid by my lodgers. I gave you
warning a fortnight ago, when I saw you had no
money; and so now you must quit, <i>willy nilly</i>.”</p>

<p>“But, Sir,” replied a voice, in a subdued tone,
“I have not been able to leave my bed, in order
to look for lodgings, until to-day; and I hope you
will not oblige me to quit your room to-night.”</p>

<p>“You may go to the room, if you wish,” replied
the landlord, “because I know the <i>law</i> don’t
allow me to lock it up&mdash;and a bad law it is; but if
you do go, you will have to sleep without a bed;
for I have removed my furniture. The short and
the long of the matter is, Sir, you owe me two
pounds; and I’ll forgive you the debt, if you
only go away to-night: that’s what I call fair
and charitable.”</p>

<p>“To-night!” returned a voice, “I cannot go;
I was scarcely able to crawl down to the Strand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
to look after a gentleman, who promised to recommend
me to where I may get money; and now I
am quite exhausted.”</p>

<p>“Exhausted! nonsense,” exclaimed the landlord’s
wife, who now ran up from the kitchen; “we
can’t be troubled with such people, and lose our
rent, too.&mdash;Parcel of poor devils of half-pay officers,
coming to London, here, to eat us up. One
word for all; I will not be humbugged out of my
lodgings.”</p>

<p>A thought struck me&mdash;it might be the poor
Captain. I opened the door&mdash;it <i>was</i> he! There
he stood in the hall, leaning upon a stick&mdash;almost
sinking with weakness. He recognised me directly,
and as he put out his hand to meet mine,
I could see his eyes filled with tears, which he
laboured to suppress. I brought him into my
room&mdash;gave him a chair at the fire&mdash;and left him
to himself a few minutes, in order that he might
compose his feelings; for to have talked to him
on the brutality of the landlord then would have
wounded him still deeper. I chose, therefore,
rather to affect ignorance of it; and while I remained
out of the room, took an opportunity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
of addressing the landlord upon his conduct, and
promised to be answerable for the Captain’s rent,
which operated a marvellous change in his demeanour
towards the poor sufferer whom he had
but a moment before treated so harshly.</p>

<p>I returned to my room and made a glass of
negus for my guest, affecting in my manners a
degree of hilarity which was at vast variance with
my real feelings. The Captain was too weak to
sit up long; he had been confined to his bed ever
since the night he had first seen me, owing to a cold
he caught on his return to his lodgings, and, therefore,
could not come to his appointment: he had
frequently requested his landlord to oblige him by
going to the house where we were to have met, and
to speak to me, whom he described; but this as
well as other favours was denied. All his money
was gone, and he had tottered down that night
as a last resource, to see me.</p>

<p>I exerted myself to make him happy: the
landlady brought him a basin of gruel, of which
he partook: his bed was prepared, and&mdash;what was
never done before for him&mdash;warmed with her pan
by her own hands. Every thing was attention,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
and my grateful friend was made as comfortable
as one suffering under a consuming disease could
be. He remained in bed from this night; and I
could see that every day he became more feeble:
the doctor who attended him informed me that
his lungs were diseased, and that his case was out
of the pale of remedy. I did every thing I could
for him; and he felt great relief, he said, from my
company; for I always kept conversation free from
melancholy.</p>

<p>About a week after this last confinement of the
Captain to his bed, the landlord offered to have
warm curtains put up; this was desirable, and as
they were already in the house, he sent for an
upholsterer to hang them. I was sitting by the
bed of the invalid when this upholsterer came in,
along with the landlord, carrying the curtains.
The Captain regarded him attentively; then whispering
he said to me, “I think I know that man:
ask him what is his name.” I did so, and the
upholsterer answered that his name was Thomas
Hanson. I beckoned to him, and he approached
the bed. The Captain then fixed his eyes upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
him, and in a weak voice said, “Tom, do you not
know me?”</p>

<p>“No, Sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Ah!” returned the Captain, “I am now so
altered that nobody knows me;” and then burst
into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>The man gazed on the sufferer intensely: he
turned to me in evident embarrassment, and whispered,
“I don’t recollect the gentleman, indeed,
Sir.”</p>

<p>A short pause took place, and the Captain wiped
his eyes with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Were you not in the **th regiment while
they served in Spain?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir; I served with them there, and since
they came home too. I have been pensioned, and
now, thank God! I’m in a good way of business,
on my own account. I assure you, Sir, I do not
recollect your face.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” rejoined the Captain, “my face and
all&mdash;all are changed. I’m very unlike the Captain
now, Tom, that led you up the hill at Talavera,
and saved your life at Salamanca.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>Hanson changed colour&mdash;he looked closer&mdash;he
recognized him&mdash;then fell on his knees by the bed
and seizing his old Captain’s hand, wept like a
child. I hurried out of the room, for I could not
bear the scene.</p>

<p>Hanson never left the bed of the dying officer
one hour at a time. However, the poor fellow
died next day; and the last sad office of closing his
eyes was performed by this faithful and humane
soldier; nay, more&mdash;from his purse came the expenses
of the funeral&mdash;his own hands made the
coffin&mdash;and no mourner ever followed the beloved
dead to the grave with a sincerer sorrow, than
Hanson did his poor Captain.

When I first entered&mdash;noo sax-an’-twenty years&mdash;we
had mates, an’ nae assistants at a’.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Kyle.</i> You are perfectly right, there;
the service had no <i>assistants</i> at that time, sure
enough.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> (<i>wiping his chin.</i>) You are too
severe, Kyle; au&mdash;hau&mdash;; you are, indeed, hau&mdash;;
I’ll trouble you for a cut out of the thick end of
that haunch of mutton; it looks delicious; au&mdash;hau&mdash;,
good indeed&mdash;very good.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p><i>Dr. Kyle.</i> I’ll send you a slice, Doctor, that
will digest on its first contact with the gastric fluid;&mdash;there,
Sir, there.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Hau&mdash;, very good. I haven’t
seen such a haunch as that since the last annual
dinner of the society for the benefit of the widows
of our department; that <i>was</i> delicious, too.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Beamish.</i> Oh, you <i>have</i> a society, then,
for the widows of your department, Doctor?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Yes, yes; I’ll tell you all about
it, by-and-by.&mdash;A little currant jelly, Thomas.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Kyle.</i> Yes, Captain, to the laudable exertions
of Sir James M’Grigor we are indebted
for a valuable fund,&mdash;sufficient to protect our
widows and our orphans, if it please God to
leave them without other means.&mdash;Mr. Lintly,
do you take mutton? Oh! Sir, it is a vast advantage.</p>

<p><i>Major Oldfield.</i> ’Pon my honour, I am very
happy to see such improvements in your department.
When I entered the service, now fifty
years ago, there was no department at all. A
surgeon was something like our present military
parson; he used to go about in plain clothes, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
with a black coat and a military cocked hat:
his pay was bad; and as to his assistant, he was
a sort of lob-lolly-boy; but now, how different!
Ah! the Duke, Heaven rest his soul!
was the first who improved <i>your</i> department,
Gentlemen, as well as every other belonging to
the army.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Major&mdash;au&mdash;I’ll trouble you for
a little of the harrico&mdash;hau: It looks very well&mdash;au&mdash;very
well, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Vice-President.</i> Splint, shall I send you a little
pig?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Splint.</i> Indeed it is a thing Mrs. Splint is
very fond of; and if you like, I’ll send my servant
up to you to-morrow for it.</p>

<p><i>Vice-President.</i> For what!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Splint.</i> Why the little pig you mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Poo&mdash;oo&mdash;au&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>A general laugh&mdash;more at the expense of Dr.
Adipose than the little pig.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Vice-President.</i> Why, my dear Sir, I asked you
to take a little of <i>this</i> roast pig.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Splint.</i> Oh dear!&mdash;I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Very good&mdash;very good joke indeed&mdash;hau.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Well, I think as you mentioned
it, I’ll taste the little pig&mdash;a <i>lee</i>tle bit, Mr. President.
Devilish good joke&mdash;thank you, that
will do.</p>

<p><i>Vice-President.</i> Yes, Major, the Duke was our
best friend; it was he who first raised the pay of
the surgeons, and thus made the situation more
worthy to be filled by men of education. Sir
James M’Grigor, and Sir William Franklin, have
completed what the Duke began, and now, thanks
to those gentlemen, our department is not only
happily organized, and its rank sustained, but we
can furnish in the field, men of genuine professional
education; not tyros of the pestle, but scientifically
bred surgeons, who can whip off your
legs while you’d be saying “Jack Robison.”&mdash;A
glass of wine, Major.</p>

<p><i>Major.</i> With great pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Mr. Vice, I’ll taste that wild
duck&mdash;hau&mdash;it looks well&mdash;and squeeze a lemon
on it:&mdash;but first we’ll take a glass of wine&mdash;hau.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Beamish.</i> I’m not so long as the Major
in the service, by twenty years, and even in <i>my</i>
time the military surgeons were in general inferior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
to what they are now, both in education and
respectability.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ward.</i> The peninsular war required a vast
deal of surgeons, and therefore, a number of
young unqualified men, of necessity were sent out
to Portugal; but since that, Sir, this very Chatham
hospital has been established; and it bids
fair to become a school for military surgeons.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Kyle.</i> By-the-by, it would not be a bad
thing to follow Buonaparte’s plan of educating medical
men for the army. The Parliament might
vote money for worse purposes than promoting the
health and comfort of the soldiers in providing a
military-medical school.&mdash;This I really believe.
Then, in case of necessity, we should not be forced
to receive indifferently educated surgeons into the
service.&mdash;Chatham would be the very place for it.
We have already a splendid anatomical museum,
a good library, and an extensive hospital. All
wanting now, is permission to receive young men
as pupils or cadets, who would be supported by
government until fit to join the army:&mdash;Something
like the Artillery-school at Woolwich. Then
the well-qualified officers of the department, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
are now receiving half-pay for nothing, might
have here something to do in lecturing as professors.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Hoot! if ya’d apply to parelament
for sic a thing, ya’d ha’ Masther Joey Hume at
wark wi’ his hammer an’ tongs:&mdash;he’d cry oot “sae
muckle for lodging&mdash;sae muckle for poorridge&mdash;an’
sae muckle for pooltices,” till he’d run up a bill
for the hoose that wad beat the <i>Docthor’s Bill</i>
clane oot an’ oot.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Kyle.</i> But Sir James and Mr. Hume are
both Aberdeen men, are they not? There might
be something done that way.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Nae, that wad do naething; Sir
James has a lang heed o’ his ain, an’ if it war to
be done at a’, he’d nae consult the calculator
aboot it.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Very true, Mr. President, hau&mdash;I’ll
thank you for another custard, au&mdash;just to
finish this apple-pie.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> First we’ll take a drap o’ wine,
Docthor; ya’r takin’ reed, so there’s the decanter.</p>

<p><i>Major Oldfield.</i> I really think the plan is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
good; for this reason:&mdash;when men expend a considerable
sum on medical education, they look to
a return; and the success of private practice is far
more tempting than the army-surgeon’s; therefore
professional education might be provided for
them at a moderate expense, and as a security,
they might be bound to remain a certain number
of years in the army.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Beamish.</i> I remember a joke which
passed current at the expense of the young surgeons
when I was at Lisbon:&mdash;a ship was hailed,
in passing up the Tagus, to learn what she
had on board, and the Master answered “<i>horses
and hospital mates, for the use of the army</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Vice President.</i> Very true: there were many
such jokes played off upon them; and this was
owing, in a great measure, to the want of such
an establishment as this at Chatham. Then, a
set of young raw Scotch or Irish pupils would
come up to London, pass their examinations, and
be ordered forthwith out to Portugal. Unacquainted
with military etiquette and the usages of
officers, it is not to be wondered that they were in
general laughed at. I myself have seen one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
medical juniors&mdash;then a dispenser of medicines,
but now Apothecary to the Forces&mdash;dressed in
a <i>brown</i> ill-made <i>surtout</i> coat, blue trowsers ending
at the calf of the leg, pepper-and-salt coloured
worsted stockings, and shoes; the whole
surmounted by a cocked hat, and straight black
feather: in one hand he carried his sword, and in
the other an umbrella!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>A laugh from all the mess, particularly convulsive

<p><i>President.</i> It’s vary deeferent noo; look at us

in oor appearance&mdash;nae gaudy gewgaws aboot us,
but neat an’ military to a degree: oor uniform is noo

Here, when a young man joins us, he learns not
only his duty, but the mode o’ appearing like a
proper meelitary surgeon, an’ joins a regiment ready
made, as it were: it was far deeferent during the
peninsular war. I can assure ya gentlemen, the
present Airmy Meedical Board deserve the highest
praise&mdash;an’ something more substantial too, for
the establishment o’ this valuable <i>heed-quarters</i>, I

<p><i>President.</i> There is something in that: Misther
Leech there, has been in the sarvice&mdash;hoo

<p><i>Assist. Surg. Leech.</i> About eight years on active
service abroad, and nearly eight more on
half-pay.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Ha! that’s a long time. I remember
when I enthered the sarvice, an assistant-surgeon
seldom remained withoot promotion for mere
nor three years, and some got it in as many
months. But this can hardly be helped noo, fra’
the encreased numbers. Hooever, it wad be an
improvement in the Department, if the juniors
were mere quickly promoted; and also a greater
number o’ gude places for the seniors to look
up to.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Right, Mr. President, hau&mdash;take
care of the seniors.&mdash;I’ll thank you for the nuts.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>a laugh.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Vice President.</i> There are not enough of high
places certainly. The situation of Inspector of
Hospitals, is all that the surgeon can fairly look
to; and of these there are not many. Now what is
that worth?&mdash;about 700<i>l.</i> a year. This, mind you,
is the <i>utmost</i> a man can look to, unless it be the
directorship of the Department; and that is but
<i>one</i> place of worth&mdash;all this after twenty or thirty
years of troublesome service:&mdash;there lies the disadvantages
of the profession. If a surgeon be
but commonly attentive, and fairly qualified, he
will soon be worth more than twice seven hundred
a year in civil practice: nay, an apothecary,
who sticks up a blue bottle at the corner of
a narrow lane in London, will soon make as good
an income as the Inspector of Hospitals.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> True enough: there ought to be
at least half a doozen gude births, o’ a thoosand a
year, by way o’ rewards for auld and meretorious
meedical oofficers; an’ the young ones ought to
run up a leettle faster. What d’ye think of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
sinecures given to the Irish Medical Board:&mdash;the
present Surgeon-general, an’ Physeecian-general,
an’ several o’ the Inspecthors, enjoy their full pay
an’ allooances, yet were never in the army at a.’
(<i>murmurs of disapprobation from all the Mess</i>) Yes,
gentlemen, ’tis fac’ as deeth:&mdash;hey! I wish the
Duke may just tak’ it into his head to examine it.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Au&mdash;hau&mdash;that’s the man for cutting
up the Doctors&mdash;hau&mdash;I’ll take the olives and
that orange, Mr. Ward&mdash;hau&mdash;thank you.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Kyle.</i> What our worthy President says
is just. Those situations in Ireland were given
to rich <i>civil</i> practitioners&mdash;I believe by one of
the Viceroys: now, really, if Viceroys choose to
reward their medical friends with good incomes,
they should not take the money out of the pockets
of those officers who have been living like gipsies
on the mountains&mdash;enduring every privation
to watch over the lives of our gallant soldiers; or
perhaps wasting their health and life in the pestilential
air of tropical hospitals. There are but
few good places in the Department, and surely
they should not be given to wealthy practitioners,
who do not belong to the army. Cheyne, Crampton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Peel&mdash;all worth at least two or three thousand
a year each by their practice&mdash;take three of our
best places from us; yet, until their present appointment,
never had anything whatever to do
with the army.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ward.</i> Yes; Crampton, I believe, was an
hospital mate for five or six months; and, I remember,
he did duty in the camp which was on
the Curragh of Kildare.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Kyle.</i> Vast service, indeed! (<i>a laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dr. Adipose.</i> Gentlemen, I’ll give you a toast&mdash;hau:&mdash;I’ll
give you&mdash;Mr. Abernethy and the
digestive organs.</p>

<p><i>Major Oldfield.</i> Gentlemen, I’m sorry my
health requires me to leave you. There was a
time when I could drink with the best of you:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
but I am seventy-six years of age, and that
I hope will be my excuse for quitting so early
this pleasant mess-table. Allow me, before I go,
to say that it gives me the greatest satisfaction
to see the hospital staff thus consolidated: many
attempts were made, during the long time I served
in the army, to establish a regular mess in this department,
but all failed. I give you joy, therefore,
gentlemen, on the attainment of the object
now: and I trust you will not receive it as flattery
when an old officer tells you, that for forty
years in the service, he never had the honour of
dining at a mess where there was more military
regularity and more enlightened members. Permit
me now, Mr. President, to drink “Prosperity
to the Medical Officers of the Army&mdash;the soldiers’
best friends in the day of sorrow.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>The Major now departed&mdash;several of the members
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
of the mess, who were on duty, also retired to
the hospital, and the remainder sat in pleasant
conversation until eleven o’clock, when they partook
of deviled turkey, specially prepared by
Doctor Adipose; and having washed it down with
a few glasses of claret, broke up for the night.

<h2 id="NIGHTS_IN_THE_GUARD_HOUSE_VI">NIGHTS IN THE GUARD-HOUSE.<br />

No. VI.</h2>

<p>“That’s the worst of the army,” said Private
Andrews to Sergeant Dobson, as he rose to open
the guard-house door&mdash;“that’s the worst of it:
we are scarcely well acquainted with the inhabitants
of a town in which we are quartered, when
the route comes, and off we go; perhaps never to
see again people that we would wish to spend our
lives with.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” replied the Sergeant; “I have
often felt that, and so have you; but I think
there is something about our leaving Ballycraggen
which touches your feelings, Andrews, a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
more than the leaving of any former quarters in
which I have seen you.”</p>

<p>“Why, to tell you the truth, I do not like to
quit that poor girl, Sergeant; she is a good, kind-hearted
creature,” returned Private Andrews, lifting
the latch for the purpose of seeing who it was
that engaged the sentry in conversation.</p>

<p>The door was opened, and in a few moments
an aged man appeared at the threshold, exclaiming
“Soldiers, I am glad to see you&mdash;blessings upon
you! It is a cold and a bleak night: I have yet
four miles to go: will you give me a seat at
your fire? I am a man of threescore and twelve
years of age, and before now my shoulder has
borne a brown bess in the service.”</p>

<p>“Come in, come in, my old fellow!” was the
answer from every man of the guard. The stranger’s
venerable appearance was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i>:
he was not only admitted to the guard-house, but
the old oak chair was resigned to him by honest
Sergeant Dobson&mdash;no small compliment, considering
the comfort and importance which it always
afforded to the Sergeant of the Guard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>The old man who was thus simultaneously
honoured, was that sort of personage which a romantic
poet would think his fortune made in getting
a sight of; and in describing him would immortalize
himself,&mdash;provided he were a true poet: the
white beard would demand a dozen stanzas:&mdash;the
Ossianic vapour of the morn curling in the breeze&mdash;the
snow upon the skirts of a towering mountain&mdash;the
surf whitening the base of the cloud-capped
sea-rock&mdash;these, and a thousand other comparisons,
would be called in to paint it. The
bald and expanded forehead would be likened to
the most polished work of ivory-turners; the
eye add a new star to the heavens; and the figure
of the man be handed down to sculptors as a
model for the venerable grandeur of humanity!</p>

<p>Now, as I am writing plain prose, I will say
without metaphor, that he was a tall man of
seventy-two years of age, with a long and silky
white beard; a good-natured countenance, and as
sound and healthy to all appearances as Corporal
O’Callaghan; who, in point of age, might have
been almost his grandson, and who took up his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
position beside him at the fire, the moment the
old man sat down.</p>

<p>“What the divil makes you wear your beard?”
said the Corporal; “couldn’t you borrow a razor
anywhere once a week?”</p>

<p>“I have worn my beard,” replied the stranger,
“for these many, many years. It is an old
friend, and tells me a history. It was never cut
since the mutiny of the Nore.”</p>

<p>“What! are you a sailor?” demanded the Sergeant.</p>

<p>“No, young man, I belonged to the Royal
Marines.”</p>

<p>“O, by the powers! he’s one o’ the red boys
afther all,” exclaimed the Corporal: “give us your
fist.&mdash;God! you’re very cowld: will you take a&mdash;”
here O’Callaghan whispered something to the
stranger, and then went to a recess in the guard-room,
where there was a bottle&mdash;in short, nothing
that could be done by the guard to show
their respect for the old soldier, was neglected:
the consequence was, that he became very communicative,
and related not only the history of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
the mutiny of the Nore, but gave them a description
of his own adventures subsequent to that
affair. There is no use in making a secret of the
matter&mdash;a bottle of potyeen whisky was dispatched,
and the party enjoyed themselves by the fire
in listening to the veteran’s stories with the greatest
attention for a couple of hours: during which time
the rain pattered, and the wind blew, unheeded
by the group. He told them he had enlisted when
a boy, and had served as a marine in several engagements.
He was entrapped into the mutiny
of the Nore; but the only part which he took
in the proceedings, was writing out in a fair
hand several papers for the mutineers&mdash;and this
he declared he did for no other purpose than
to indulge his own vanity, in displaying his fine
writing, upon which he had highly valued himself.
He was tried after the surrender of the mutineers,
and transported for life to Van Diemen’s
Land. Amongst the stories with which he amused
the guard, the most interesting was the following,
in which he himself was a principal actor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<h3>THE BUSH-RANGERS.</h3>

<p>“I had not been more than two or three weeks
in Hobart Town, when I was assigned as a crown
servant to a worthy gentleman&mdash;Mr. Allen&mdash;with
whom I lived, until it pleased God to call him
away from this life: I served him faithfully, and
he treated me more like a relation than a slave.
He failed in business as a merchant a year before
his death, and I believe it preyed upon his mind.
He left scarcely any property behind him, but
what there was, he willed to me:&mdash;seventeen pounds
was all that remained after the whole of his things
were sold by auction, and his funeral expenses
paid. This sum fell to me. I was very happy
while Mr. Allen lived; but after that, I began to
think of obtaining my liberty, in order to return
home to this country, for there was nobody I
cared about in the colony. I was applied to by a
Mr. M’Carthy, to undertake the overseeing of his
land; and I accepted the offer. I had my choice
of places; for old Jack Worral&mdash;that’s my name&mdash;was
well respected by every free settler in the
country. Shortly after my going to Mr. M’Carthy’s,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
the Bush-rangers became very troublesome:
there was a gang of them&mdash;about seven-and-twenty&mdash;out
in the woods and wild country; and they
used to come down of a night and plunder the
settlers of everything&mdash;neither cattle nor corn, nor
house, was secure from their depredations. Mr.
M’Carthy had a fine schooner lying in the Derwent,
loaded with goods; he feared that the Bush-rangers
would plunder her; for his neighbour, a Mr.
Carlisle, had been recently robbed by them, and he,
himself, had seen some of them shooting kangaroos
on the banks of the river. He therefore mentioned
to me, that he would like to form a party to go in
pursuit of them. I volunteered to be one; for
although then near sixty years of age, I could manage
the best of them. Several of the neighbours
instantly joined:&mdash;there were Mr. Triffit, and Murphy,
and Jemmot, and Brown, and Carlisle, and
Tooms, and Hacking, and O’Berne, the master of
our schooner, the Geordy, and three or four sailors.
Every man had a fowling-piece or a musket&mdash;some
had also pistols, and swords, and bayonets. We
started on the track of the Bush-rangers, just an
hour before sunrise, of a beautiful twilight-night,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
in the latter end of spring: our direction was towards
the centre of a space, between two high hills,
which was about three miles away, and where there
was an open valley on the banks of a small river: we
used to call it the fairy’s valley, on account of the
little patches of green pasturage which every where
appeared through the thick and matted brushwood?]&mdash;for
you know it is said, that these are the
spots where the <i>good people</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> dance of a moonlight
night.</p>

<p>“We travelled on after our guide, who was a
native that lived in the service of Mr. Carlisle, and
who had been ill-treated by the Bush-rangers but
a few days before, when they were plundering his
master’s house: there was no road or path, as you
might see in other countries&mdash;our way was over
hills, and over craggs, and through jungles of
brushwood, so that we were an hour and a half
before we got into the opening of the valley. The
sun was up and mists disappearing; the place as
silent as the grave&mdash;nothing to be heard but whatever
noise ourselves made. Mr. M’Carthy now proposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
that we should lie down, under cover of an
overhanging rock, in a sort of green cave, thatched,
as it were, with briers, bushes, and flowers, of every
description: he said we had better halt and send
out one or two as scouts: this we did; and the
guide, with Mr. Murphy himself, after having
taken a little refreshment by way of breakfast,
climbed up the side of a steep hill, through the
bushes, in order to get a complete view of all
round from the top. While they were away we
examined all our arms, and took our breakfast of
cold meat and a small allowance of grog, dealt
out by Mr. M’Carthy&mdash;for he kept charge of
the spirits himself, lest any one should take too
much. In about a quarter of an hour after Mr.
Murphy and the guide went out, we heard a shot
which rattled and echoed three or four times across
the valley: this, as we afterwards learned, was fired
by one of the Bush-rangers at a bird, and in the
sight of the guide, who now came creeping down
the hill with Mr. Murphy, making signs for silence.
Our scouts informed us that the Bush-rangers
were within shot, roasting mutton under a hill;
but that to come upon them without being observed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
it would require us to return and advance
by an opening on the other side of them&mdash;a rising
ground that was clear under-foot, but covered with
immense trees. We immediately proceeded one
by one to the rear, and in about ten minutes were
in view of the smoke from the Bush-rangers’ fires;
and by stooping so as to screen ourselves from the
possible view of the robbers, we were enabled to
get within about a hundred yards of them. Mr.
M’Carthy ordered us to lie down, which we did.
We could hear the fellows through the bushes,
cursing, swearing, and laughing; some were cooking
pieces of mutton, others lolling on the grass,
smoking and drinking: and a pretty, interesting-looking
native girl, sat playing with the long
and bushy black ringlets of a stout and wicked-looking
man seated by her: he had pistols in his
belt&mdash;wore a fustian jacket, a kangaroo-skin cap
and waistcoat, with leather gaiters, and dirty velveteen
breeches. I saw him as plainly as I see any
one here; and what do you think? the fellow
had two watches in his fob! This turned out, as
I learned afterwards, to be Michael Howe, the second
in command of the robbers: at that time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Whitehead was the leader&mdash;a tall, ill-looking villain
as ever you saw: <i>he</i> was also there, asleep on
the grass.</p>

<p>“We were now directed by Mr. M’Carthy to
cock our pieces, and on a wave of his hand to rise
and show ourselves, but not to fire until the word
was given; and also, that if the Bush-rangers attempted
to fire, to drop down so as to avoid the
shot, and, if not possible to advance at once upon
them, we were each to take a position behind a tree,
and from thence fire upon the robbers: this was the
plan of attack. Mr. M’Carthy now rose up, and
with his piece at the ‘<i>ready</i>,’ cried out to Whitehead
to surrender: the Bushmen were up in a
moment, and behind a tremendous trunk of a hollow
tree, through a hole in which we could see
them. Whitehead replied to the summons very
coolly; ‘I tell you what, M’Carthy,’ said he,
‘you will never be easy until I settle you: I
spared your life last Thursday night; and if you
want not to lose it, go home about your business.’</p>

<p>“Mr. M’Carthy now waved his hand, when we
all stood up, and came to the present. Whitehead
got behind the tree.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>“‘Put down your guns,’ said he, ‘and I’ll
speak to you.’</p>

<p>“Mr. M’Carthy ordered us to comply; we took
them from our shoulders, but still held them with
our fingers on the triggers.</p>

<p>“‘Now,’ said Whitehead, ‘let me advise you
to leave us alone; we are well armed, and can beat
you; but we don’t want blood: let us alone, I
say, and go back to your homes. A man of us
will not be taken alive.’</p>

<p>“‘If you surrender quietly, Whitehead,’ replied
Mr. M’Carthy, ‘I can assure you pardon from
the Government: you see my party is strong, so
don’t force me to fire.’</p>

<p>“Michael Howe then roared out, ‘Slap at the
beggars!’&mdash;a volley was fired at us through the
hole in the tree; and which we returned. On looking
round at our party, after I had fired, I saw
Carlisle, Murphy, Jemmot, Triffet, and O’Berne,
lying on the ground, but none of them quite dead.</p>

<p>“Whitehead now cried out to us, with an oath,
to surrender; but we reloaded fast, and kept up
such a hedge-firing, that one of the fellows dared
not show himself, to present his piece. I called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
out to our party to take aim at every shot, and
only two to fire at a time. Some of the sailors now
led away four of our wounded party; but Mr.
Murphy could not be stirred, he was shot through
the belly, and remained: Mr. Carlisle died on our
way home; and O’Berne, who was shot in the
face, expired in four days after. We were obliged
to retreat, firing as we went; but the Bushmen
had no wish to follow us. The fact is, Mr. M’Carthy
ought to have opened on them at first, without
giving them a moment’s consideration, and then
should have run right in upon the fellows.</p>

<p>[“To be sure,” replied Sergeant Dobson; “they
should not have given them a moment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, faith! that’s where they put their foot in
it, completely,” rejoined Corporal O’Callaghan, as
he offered the horn cup to the old man. “Wet
your whistle,” said he, “before you go any farther.”</p>

<p>This was done in due form, and the venerable
soldier renewed his story with encreased energy
and pleasure:&mdash;]</p>

<p>“It was a disastrous end to our expedition, and
the death of these unfortunate men caused a
panic throughout the settlement: the 73d was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
ordered out, in detachments, to scour the country;
but the Bushmen knew too well how to avoid
them&mdash;they had a world of unpopulated country,
of the finest nature, to retire into. However,
a party of the soldiers came so close on them one
day, that they found their meat burning on the
fire, where they had placed it to broil, while the
sheepskin was beside it, out of which the mutton
was cut; but they could not catch a man of
them.</p>

<p>“It might well be expected, that if the Bush-rangers
could, they would not let Mr. M’Carthy
rest after this attempt upon their lives; and we
so much expected their vengeance, that we made
preparation to protect ourselves immediately. Mr.
M’Carthy obtained permission to keep a party of
the 46th regiment in the house, night and day; the
house being situated so lonely. The robbers were
not aware of this, or they would not have ventured
to make the attack, which they did in a very short
time after the failure of our expedition against
them. I was sitting at the fire one night, along
with the soldiers, talking of one thing or another,
when the window was knocked in by a volley from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
without, and by which one of the soldiers was
wounded in the arm. Mr. M’Carthy was from
home at the time. Up the men jumped, and seizing
their muskets, fired out instantly. I and a
soldier ran down stairs and out at one of the back
doors, when looking over a wall, we perceived a
man at the front of the house: he was alone, and
was beckoning to others to come on. I levelled
at him,&mdash;fired:&mdash;he jumped off the ground, two
yards at least, and then fell; but got up, and
ran towards another of his comrades, crying out,
‘Howe&mdash;here, take my watch&mdash;the beggars have
shot me.’ These were his last words: he then
fell. Several of the soldiers now ran round, to
get in the rear of the Bushmen, who, quite undaunted,
were approaching the house. Several
shots were fired both by and at the soldiers a
little way from the gate. I now perceived a man
approaching the dead body of the fellow I shot: I
had no other charge for my gun, and no bayonet,
so I returned into the house to load; when casting
my eyes from the window, I saw the figure
engaged over the body, taking his money, as I
then thought. The light was out; the soldiers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
were gone from the house, engaged with the robbers,
so I could not find either a grain of powder
or a cartridge. I made up my mind in a moment
to attack the fellow I saw below, with the but-end
of my musket, so down I ran for that purpose,
and was coming behind a ridge of dung or manure,
in order to make sure of my man, when I saw the
fellow&mdash;it was Howe&mdash;with the head of the dead
man in his hand! he gazed a moment at the body,
and then said he, ‘Poor Jack Whitehead, I swore
to you, that if ever you fell near me, I’d not let
your head be taken; the b&mdash;&mdash;y governor won’t
know you now, and no beggar shall get a rap for
you, my boy: lie there, brave fellow, and I’ll bury
your head for you in our own green valley&mdash;I know
you would have done the same for me.’ I was petrified
with astonishment; so Howe got off, and left
the mutilated trunk in a pool of blood: he had cut
off the head with his clasp knife. The body was
taken away next day to Hobart Town, and gibbited
on Hunter’s island. The soldiers, I believe,
did not hit any of them&mdash;the night was too dark
and the Bushmen too wary. If I could have got
a cartridge when Howe was cutting off his comrade’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
head, I should have settled him; and as it
turned out, this Howe was the worst villain of the
whole. On the death of Whitehead, he became
the head of the gang, and committed the most
terrible depredations every where; there was a reward
of 100 guineas offered for his head; and that
was twice the sum offered for any of the others.
There was also a free pardon, with a passage home
to England, ready for any of the crown prisoners
who would take him or any of his men. The hope
of getting back to my own country once more made
me turn my attention particularly to this point,
and as Mr. M’Carthy offered to assist me in all
my projects, I set about the means of accomplishing
them.</p>

<p>“I was once very near seizing Howe in the very
centre of Hobart-Town, where he was in the
disguise of a gentleman. I’ll tell you how it was:
I was in a store one day, buying some powder and
shot, when this fellow came in: the man’s name
who kept the store was Stevens. Although Howe
changed colour the moment he entered and saw
me, yet I did not observe that it <i>was</i> he; but
when I heard him speak in his peculiarly vulgar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
way, I remembered the voice of the fellow who
cut off the head of Whitehead. Strong as Howe
was, I thought I was stronger; so without hesitation
I grasped him by the collar, and told him that he
was my prisoner: he struggled hard with me, and
held on my throat; and I had got him fast at the
back part of the store, when I was knocked down
by a blow on the back of my head, and became
senseless. It was some minutes before I recovered
myself; and when I came to my senses, I found
Stevens holding some strong spirits to my lips,
and otherwise kindly attending me. He told me
that a strange man had rushed into the store,
and with a bludgeon knocked me on the head
while I was struggling with Howe; and that when
I fell from the blow, Howe jumped up and both
ran away: little I then thought that it was Stevens
himself who struck me and released Howe.
This soon was brought to light; for information
was given to the governor that Stevens was a receiver
of Howe’s plunder; so he was hanged on
Hunter’s Island, and buried under the gibbets of
three of his correspondents. The fellow confessed
to me in the jail, that it was he who struck me,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
and said he was only sorry he had not killed me.
This man was a crown prisoner, but was thought
to be an industrious person who was making a fortune
by his business: two youths, his accomplices,
were sentenced to death along with him, but were
pardoned at the place of execution, on account of
their tender years. It was this man, or some of
his connexions, who used to supply the Bushmen
with information, and also with necessaries.&mdash;As
an instance of this&mdash;the gang appeared at Port
Dalrymple, where they robbed one Mr. Rose, and
in only eleven days after that, when the soldiers
were scouring the neighbourhood in which this
robbery was committed, they appeared at Bagdad&mdash;a
distance of one hundred miles from Port Dalrymple,
and intercepted a waggon load of valuable
property belonging to a Mr. Stocker, who traded
from one settlement to another: this they never
could have accomplished unless they had information
from their colleagues in Hobart Town.</p>

<p>“I now obtained leave to accompany a party of
the 46th regiment on a regular campaign against
the Bush-rangers. We carried with us flour, spirits,
and some live stock; the weather being fine,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
we wanted no tents&mdash;and even if we had we could
not have carried them. My arms were a musket
and two pistols; my powder-horn and bullet-bag
slung across my shoulder: I did not look much
unlike Robinson Crusoe, with my long beard; and
I was as often called by that name as by my own.
I never passed a pleasanter time than for the three
weeks we were out on the excursion, except when
we lost our flour in a ford; and then we were so
reduced that some of our party gnawed away their
mocassions, or kangaroo-skins which they wore on
their feet. Although we did not destroy the gang
on this campaign, we were the means of hanging
four of the Bush-rangers. On the third day’s march
after we started, we were close to a place called
the <i>Tea-tree Brush</i>, and were poking our way
through a thick and wide bed of briers and brushwood,
in order to get over to an open and green
space shaded with trees, where we proposed cooking
a quarter of mutton, when we spied a smoke
rising from the very trees we were approaching.
We were soon on the clear ground, and the whole
party advanced as quick as possible towards the
smoke, determined to give no quarter to the Bushmen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
unless they surrendered. We now could see
a hut made of boughs, and a fire before it, when
out darted two men, and in a moment disappeared
into a close thicket, and we lost them. In this
hut we found several watches and trinkets, some
cloth, twenty-five bullets, some powder, and
three kangaroo dogs, all of which we took with
us, first having dined heartily upon our mutton in
front of the hut&mdash;and such a beautiful situation
for a bivouac I never was in. It was a flat piece
of green land, covered with wild flowers, and overlooking
the most beautiful country that can be
imagined&mdash;a precipice in our front, from which we
hurled a stone that rolled over half a mile of a
steep hill down to a river all studded with islands,
and ornamented by the most delightfully displayed
foliage on its banks&mdash;plain over plain, and wood
over wood, was to be seen for twenty miles’ distance;
and the blue mountains far away gave one
an idea of an earthly paradise: yet no human
being claimed it&mdash;none ever trod over this fine
country but a few lawless brigands.</p>

<p>“We were now on the scent of the Bushmen,
and I proposed a plan which turned out well;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
this was, that we should lie in ambush all the
evening in a covered recess near the hut, and
watch the return of some of the gang, whom we
had no doubt were out hunting. This was approved
by the Sergeant in command of us, and
we immediately retired to the ambuscade: here
we smoked our pipes:&mdash;it was so situated, that we
could see all around without being ourselves perceived.</p>

<p>“We had been in this situation about two hours,
when we espied four of the Bushmen; Howe was
one of them; and the native girl, whom I saw playing
with his curls before, was with him. Both
were armed with pistols. Her dress was neither
native nor European, but a very pretty sort of costume
made up of skins, feathers, and white calico.
They advanced towards the hut, until they came
to within about three hundred yards of it, when
the girl, who was before them, ran quickly back,
seized Howe by the arm, and pointed to the
hut. What was the reason of this I cannot tell:
perhaps she saw something about it that excited
suspicion&mdash;but, be that as it may, the whole party
turned round, and fled for the valley, by an open,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
clear, and slanting ground which led into it. Out
we ran after them, and were gaining a little upon
them when we came to the bottom of the valley.
They here took different directions; but Howe was
our man; so after him we all went, dashing up the
opposite hill from that on which the hut was;
for all parties had forded&mdash;the water taking nearly
up to the middle. When Howe and his girl,
who followed him closely, gained the summit of
the hill, he turned round, deliberately took
aim at one of us with his fusee, and fired; but
without effect. This was returned by three of
our party, but also without effect. Our chase
now was over a tolerably open country, and I dare
say that we all ran at nearly full speed for about
a mile&mdash;Howe before us, apparently taking it
very easy; but he must have run amazingly well,
to have distanced us so much in a mile, and
with such seeming ease to himself. The girl, we
could observe, was falling fast behind, but she
still ran, and we could see Howe frequently motioning
her on: at last the poor thing stopped
short at once, as if overcome by fatigue. Howe
roared at her, with a voice that sounded over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
plain, and although five hundred yards from us,
we heard it like the blast of a trumpet. What do
you think he did, when he found that she could
not move? the dog drew his pistol&mdash;fired at her&mdash;and
the poor girl fell. I could not resist the feeling
of rage which then took possession of me: I
dropped on my knee, took a cool aim, and fired.”</p>

<p>[“Did you kill the rascal?” interrupted O’Callaghan.</p>

<p>“No. I suppose from the exertion of running,
my aim was not as it in general was. However, we
were rather far away for any thing like a certain
shot.”]</p>

<p>“We continued the chase, and in about five minutes
Howe arrived at an abrupt ravine, into which
he darted; and we might as well have attempted
to seek him in the bottom of the sea, as the place
he sunk into; so we returned to the girl, whom
we found was not dead, but severely wounded in
the shoulder and neck. When we lifted her up,
she trembled, and attempted to fall on her knees,
to supplicate for mercy, as she expected to be shot
instantly: but we soon relieved her fears, and led
her to a shade, where we made a covering of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
branches for her, and otherwise assisted her, by
tying up her arm in a sling, and washing the
blood off it. The unhappy girl now offered to
point us out the track of the robbers, and do
every thing she could, to forward our views. We
halted for the night, and at daybreak next morning
proceeded on our search, guided by the girl,
who was now able to walk.</p>

<p>“After a slow march of three hours, having passed
through the ravine into which Howe went, we
arrived at the verge of the river Shannon. Here
were several huts which the girl said the Bushmen
occasionally inhabited&mdash;that is, whenever they
moved in that part of the country; nothing,
however, was in these huts but beds of leaves and
dry grass: there were strewed about several sheep
skins, and marks of recent fires. The girl informed
us that she had been there with Howe four days
before. In a few minutes she ran over to the Sergeant,
and pointing to the opposite bank of the
Shannon, exclaimed, ‘There is Geary.’ We all
looked across the river and saw one of the Bushmen
with his gun levelled at us: he fired, and the
ball splashed in the water close to us. It was no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
use to waste our powder, for the fellow disappeared.
We then set fire to the huts, and guided by the
girl proceeded on our march. It would astonish
you to see how she discovered the tracks of the
robbers; she would sometimes go on fast, and at
others stop, look attentively at the grass and leaves
under her, and although we could see no mark of
footsteps, she declared she did: she would minutely
examine each leaf and brier and blade of grass on
a spot where she was ‘at fault,’ in order to see
were they broken or pressed; and in this way she
brought us to a creek of the river near which she
said was a hut, and that very likely some of the
gang were there. We had scarcely arrived on a
high rock which overhung the water of the creek
when we heard a shot close to us, and a desperate-looking
fellow with a rifle in his hand instantly
darted past us: he evidently had no expectation of
meeting such <i>friends</i> as the soldiers at this place,
for when he saw us he wheeled about and attemped
to retreat, but two active fellows of our
party leaped down into a hollow and completely
cut him off. We were on the top of the rock, and
within twenty yards of the Bushman. The fellow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
stopped an instant: we were just going to
seize him, when he at once made a spring, and
down off the rock he leaped into the water below,
first having flung his gun away. The distance
he fell was about a hundred feet. He sunk; but
rose in a moment and commenced to swim to the
opposite side. The two of our party who before
had stopped him, now made for the other bank of
the creek, and if they had not run extremely well
and leaped a craggy ravine at the upper end of it,
the Bushman would have escaped; but they were
in time; and when the fellow was approaching the
bank, they appeared, and pointed their muskets
down at him. I almost pitied the wretch when
this took place, he looked so miserable; but he did
not surrender: he swam back to the centre of the
creek and there cried out to us that if we would
not fire he would propose fair terms: he was
then below us; muskets were levelled at him from
both sides, and an instant would have sent him to
the bottom. The Sergeant asked what terms he
wanted? He replied that he wished to be taken
as an approver, and that he would discover all he
knew of the gang. ‘Come ashore,’ said the Sergeant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
‘trust to the Governor for your life&mdash;I can
make no terms with you: but if you refuse to submit,
we’ll blow you into atoms the next instant.’
The fellow paused, and looked wildly up at both
sides of the creek, there death was staring him in
the face&mdash;and such a face of horror I never saw.
He had nothing left him but submission; so he
cried out, ‘Very well, Sergeant, I’ll submit; but I
hope you’ll mention my proposal to the Governor.’
The wretch now swam to the opposite bank, and
yielded himself to the custody of the two soldiers
there, while we proceeded round to join them. On
our way we had to go a considerable distance,
unless we all leaped the ravine, which was so well
done by the two of our party on the other side;
this we had no motive for,&mdash;it was dangerous;
and besides that, the female who was along with us
could not, if <i>we</i> could. We were passing through
very long grass and high weeds, nearly up to our
heads, when the girl cried out to us to stop. She
said that somebody had gone this way bleeding; and
showed blood on the weeds, evidently but lately
spilt. She also said, that there was a Bushman’s
hut, about a hundred yards away. We therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
changed our intention of going to the other side of
the creek, and sent a man to assist in bringing
round to us the prisoner, while we went to the expected
hut; at the same time marking the spot
where the blood was. The girl pointed out the
place where the hut lay,&mdash;we could not then see
it; but on approaching a little further, discovered
it in a hollow, beautifully surrounded with trees and
close brushwood. We halted, and presented our
muskets at the opening of the hut, while the Sergeant
called out to know was there any body there?
and threatening to fire, if they did not come out.
No answer:&mdash;so we advanced&mdash;entered it&mdash;and
there beheld a dead man&mdash;his head nearly severed
from his body, and a bloody razor beside him&mdash;the
ground and grass bed on which the body lay,
soaked with blood. Without removing the corpse,
we waited, until the prisoner and his escort
came up. The Bushman was led to see the body:
he showed no astonishment; but merely said, with
an affected pity, ‘Aye, that’s poor Peter Septon:
he often said he’d cut his own throat, but now I
see he has done it completely.’ ‘That’s a lie,
you villain,’ said I; ‘no man ever cut his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
throat in that manner: this was done by you.’
The wretch’s countenance could not change much
for the worse; however, his clammy lips quivered,
and he wiped the sweat off his forehead,
as he replied that he knew nothing about the
murder. ‘Murder!’ said I; ‘then you think
it <i>is</i> a <i>murder</i>?’ ‘Why,’ replied he, ‘when a
man cuts his own throat&mdash;isn’t that murder?’
‘<i>You</i> did it!’ cried out every one present; and
the prisoner’s eyes evidently answered, ‘<i>I did.</i>’</p>

<p>“It was now proposed to trace the track of the
blood, and having left four of our party at the
hut to take care of the prisoner, we followed the
girl, at a short distance, through various places:
she of course was guided by the blood. In about
ten minutes, our guide beckoned to us, and we
quickly approached to where she stood; there she
pointed to a man lying in the long grass, and
bleeding profusely&mdash;it was a desperate Bushman
of the name of Collyer.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> We raised him up; he
was weak and faint from loss of blood; his hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
was shattered by a shot, and his throat partially
cut. The poor wretch was then carried by the
men back to the hut, and having tasted a little
spirits grew something stronger. He sat leaning
against a tree; and looking at the other prisoner
with a scowl, he cried out to him, ‘You treacherous
villain! thank God, you are taken!’ Then
addressing us, he said, ‘That rascal, while I was
asleep, attempted to cut my throat with a razor,
after he had killed his comrade Septon, who slept
beside me; and as I was trying to escape from
him, he fired at me, and shattered my hand.’
The murderer now, like a fiend, roared out
‘D&mdash;n your eyes and heart, I wish I had cut
your throat first, and now you would not be here
to tell me of it.’ At this moment, the girl cried
out to him, ‘Hillier, you killed my sister, too.’
‘Yes, you black devil, and if I had you now
in the Tallow Chandler’s Shop,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> I’d serve you in
the same way.’</p>

<p>“We immediately tied Hillier’s arms well, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
having bound up Collyer’s wounds, and refreshed
ourselves, we took the direction of home. Collyer
was able to walk after he rested and took a little
spirits and water. The dead man’s head we made
Hillier cut off and carry&mdash;hung round his neck in
a haversack.”</p>

<p>[“What was that for?” demanded Sergeant
Dobson.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>“Because,” replied the old man, “there was
50<i>l.</i> reward for every Bushman’s head; a hundred
for Howe’s or Geary’s, and seventy-five for
Collyer’s.”</p>

<p>“That was sufficient reason,” rejoined the Sergeant.</p>

<p>“By Gad! it was a very good thing, to make
the rascal carry home his own work; and I hope
he was paid his wages for it,” said O’Callaghan.]</p>

<p>“That he was,” replied old Worral; “both he
and Collyer were gibbetted on Hunter’s Island, beside
the whistling bones of Whitehead, and the two
fellows who escaped us at the time we started them
out of the hut; their names were Burne and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
M’Guire, and I’ll tell you how they were taken. As
soon as they were off through the thicket from our
party, they made their way down to Kangaroo
Point&mdash;for they were completely cut off from the
gang; and wishing to go to Bass’s Straits, by
which they would be safe, they applied to a settler
to let them have a boat, for which service they
offered him a watch. The settler, who had often
lost his cattle and corn by the Bush-rangers, pretended
to accept their proposal, and having requested
them to wait at a certain place until he
returned with the boat, went to Hobart’s Town,
and returned with a party of soldiers:&mdash;the robbers
were surrounded and taken. Burne, a hardy old
fellow, attempted to escape, and had broken his
way through the soldiers, when a shot took
him in the leg, and down he dropped. They
were tried for the murder of Mr. Carlisle, and
gibbetted.”</p>

<p>“[Well, how did you get on with the prisoners,
Collyer and the murderer?” demanded Jack Andrews.]</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. We did very well; but met
with no more of the Bush-rangers. I should have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
mentioned that the girl, when we halted on the
evening we took the two robbers, gave us a history
of her treacherous paramour, Howe; and
all she said about him was corroborated by both
Collyer and Hillier, who were present while she
told us what she knew about him. We halted in
a very beautiful spot, beside a clear river, in which
we could see the fish frolicking about as if they
wanted us to cook them for dinner; and all sorts
of curious birds were as plenty as sparrows in this
country. The place was a green dry piece of
flat, close to a thick wood, and at the bottom of a
hill. On the opposite side of the river, hill after
hill arose, covered with wood; also, at the edge
of the river there were a dozen Kangaroos skipping
about, but they took care to keep far enough
from us. There were several giants of trees at
different distances; and under one of those we
lighted a fire; having first tied our prisoners together
and fastened them to an immense bough,
that was hanging from its parent trunk, splintered
perhaps by a storm.</p>

<p>“We cooked the remaining meat we had by
broiling it; and all ate hearty of this and some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
ember cakes we the day before made. All rested
under the shade; for we were tolerably fatigued.
It was here that Mary, the native girl,
told us about Howe: she said that she first saw
him at Hobart Town, where he was a crown
servant to Mr. Ingle, and she a servant to another
settler there: she was then only seventeen years
of age, and really must have been a very good-looking
young girl, for a sort of a black as she
was. Howe got the better of her so, that he
prevailed upon her to let him into the house to
rob her master, and then elope with him to the
woods. He was very kind to her, she said, whenever
he was successful; but if anything crossed
his temper, he was like a tiger; and then,
neither she nor his men would go near him until
his passion cooled. He was jealous of this girl;
and Edwards&mdash;one of the gang&mdash;after they had
robbed Captain Townson, gave Mary a shawl,
which was part of the booty; when Howe drew
his pistol deliberately, and shot him. He also
killed another of his gang, Bowls, for merely
firing a blank shot over his head: he deliberately
tied his hands and feet first, then put the pistol to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
his head and fired: this he did on Salt-pan Plains.
None of the men dared remonstrate with him; for
he always was armed with three or four pistols
ready loaded; and he often used to impress upon
his gang, that every leader should be obeyed in
whatever he ordered&mdash;that no murmurs should be
heard; and always concluded his remarks on such
subjects by a terrible oath&mdash;that life was nothing
to him, and if they did not like his conduct, they
might try it with him in any way they wished;
‘but,’ said he, ‘I <i>will</i> shoot any of my men if I
think they deserve it.’ She said that he was very
revengeful: he sat on one of the hills of thick
wood, which rise one above the other and overlook
Hobart Town, one night with Mary beside him,
smoking and drinking, and more merry than ever
she knew him to be, because he was to have satisfaction
of Mr. Humphries, and Mr. Reardon the
constable. Collyer was with him that night; and
while she was telling us about the affair, he often set
her right on little points, which she had forgotten.
She said, that they sat in their hut, looking out
over the hills below them, and the town, and the
plains: they could just discern the houses through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
the closing twilight. As it grew dark, and the view
was lost, Howe filled his goblet, and exclaimed,
‘Now, Collyer, we want light; here’s success to
the hand that will give it to us.’ Collyer drank
the toast, and Mary got up to strike a spark in
the tinder, when Howe laughed loudly, and seizing
the girl by the arm, he replied, ‘Sit down,
Mary&mdash;don’t trouble yourself; Whitehead is
lighting a match for us.’ She did not understand
him, for Whitehead, she knew, was gone down,
with the rest of the gang, to the low lands.
‘Look out,’ said he: ‘now do you see the light?’
The girl looked as he desired her:&mdash;so did Collyer
and himself; and they beheld a tremendous
flame, at two different points below, which threw
a glare all over the plain. ‘There,’ said Howe,
‘these fires have cost a pretty penny:&mdash;that is all
the corn that Humphreys reaped this season; and
that, near it, is the last of Reardon’s property.’
Then said he to Collyer, ‘My boy, a toast:&mdash;Here’s
success to the Bushman’s tinder-box, and a blazing
fire to their enemies!’&mdash;I remember that Collyer
smiled when Mary recited this before him.”</p>

<p>[“Well, by the powers!” observed Corporal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
O’Callaghan, “I never hard o’ such a divil as that
same Misther Howe. What counthryman was
he?”]</p>

<p>“A Yorkshireman: he was born at Pontefract
in 1787, entered the merchant service at Hull,
and then became a man-o’-war’s man; but he deserted,
and robbed a miller; for which he was
transported. Captain Cross of the <i>Indefatigable</i>,
brought him out to Van Diemen’s Land: before
he sailed, he tried to escape by jumping from the
main deck over the vessel’s side; and Captain
Cross said that he swam a quarter of a mile before
he was retaken.”</p>

<p>[“Well, did you bring in your prisoners safe,”
demanded Sergeant Dobson.]</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied old Worral; “we lodged them in
Hobart Town jail, and they were both gibbetted
along with Whitehead, Brown, and M’Guire.”</p>

<p>[“And was Howe ever taken?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the end of the villain.”</p>

<p>“Stop,&mdash;come to the end o’ <i>that</i> first,” said
O’Callaghan, handing old Worral the horn goblet.]</p>

<p>Worrel proceeded:&mdash;“After this, Howe having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
separated from his few remaining associates,
had art enough to obtain pardon from the
governor, by humbling to him, and offering
not only to give himself up, but to engage in
annihilating the remaining bush-rangers. He
was absolutely at large in Hobart Town&mdash;or at
least, only accompanied by a constable&mdash;awaiting
his pardon; and every body looked upon him as
reformed, when he slipped off from his keeper, and
took to his old habits: but he did not join any
others; he wandered about alone, without any communication
with mankind, except when necessity
drove him to plunder an unguarded settler: totally
shut out from man, he lived the sole occupier of
an immense tract of the most beautiful country,
as yet untrodden by any human foot but his; for
the part he selected was the distant and unknown
lands: there would he wander while his powder
and shot lasted, and then return to replenish
his stock by plunder, committing the most wanton
acts of atrocity.</p>

<p>“There was a determined fellow of the name of
Slambow, who took care of sheep for a Mr. Williams,
of Hobart Town: he lived on his land in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
the neighbourhood of New Norfolk: this man had
frequently been accosted by Howe in his rambles,
and for aught we knew, did little jobs for him, as
much out of fear as love. Howe had now gone to
this Slambow, to request him to carry a letter to
the Governor; and the request having been complied
with, an appointment was made between
them to meet at an unfrequented place the following
Friday, at sunrise. Slambow, in the meantime,
met with a runaway, called Watts, who had
been wandering about New Norfolk, and they
united in a plan to take Howe when he came to
give his letter. Watts was tired of his ranging
life, and hoped for pardon, as well as a passage to
England, if he captured him. The appointed
spot was on the banks of the Derwent river; and
Watts took a boat on the Thursday night, and
went close up to it; when concealing his boat,
he lay himself in a close thicket for the night, to
await the coming of Howe and Slambow. A little
before sunrise Watts arose from his lair
and proceeded to fulfil his appointment, he met
Slambow, who then informed him that he was to
meet Howe at a place about half a mile away,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
called <i>Long Bottom</i>: Watts requested Slambow
to hide his gun where he could find it on their
return, because he said Howe might object to
come to them, if he saw him armed&mdash;as to Watts
being armed, Howe knew he was a Bushman, and
would not suspect any thing wrong: this was done,
and they proceeded to Long Bottom, where they
arrived just as the sun was rising. I saw this
very place, myself&mdash;it is a wide plain near the
river, but skirted by abrupt mountains; here and
there it is spread with bushes and trees, and in
the centre is a creek or nook of the river. When
they had come within about a hundred yards of
this creek, Slambow hallooed loudly; and at the
signal Howe appeared. As soon as he saw them,
he requested Watts to shake the priming out of
his gun, and offered to do the same himself: this
was accordingly done by both, and they walked
together conversing on different matters, when
Howe proposed to light a fire and have some
breakfast: this was agreed upon&mdash;the wood was
collected, and set fire to&mdash;the haversacks opened&mdash;and
they were apparently about to enjoy a Bushranger’s
breakfast, when Watts, who was a strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
man, came behind Howe&mdash;threw him down&mdash;and
there held him while Slambow tied his hands.</p>

<p>“Having secured their prey, they sat down to
their breakfast; and after having finished their
meal, set out for Hobart Town. They had not gone
more than eight miles when Howe, who had found
means to loosen the cords on his hands, drew a
knife and stabbed Watts, who fell from the blow,
and dropped his gun. Slambow was below a bank,
and thus prevented from seeing what Howe had
done; nor did he suspect until he heard Watts
groan, and saw Howe presenting a gun at his
breast. The next moment he was dead; for Howe
fired and shot him. Watts then cried out to Howe,
‘Have you shot Slambow?’ to which Howe replied
that he had, and that he would serve Watts the
same way as soon as he could load his gun. Upon
this Watts got up and ran about two hundred yards,
the blood trickling from his side as he ran: here
he fell and lay for a short time, being overcome by
loss of blood. Howe did not follow him, fearing
an alarm from the shot he had fired; but took his
way back to the wilds, happy to have yet that resource
from the gallows. Watts crawled to a settler’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
house, and was conveyed to the hospital, where he
gave an account of the affair, and soon after expired.
The inquest on both bodies brought a
verdict of wilful murder against Michael Howe.</p>

<p>“This last violence threw the people into consternation,
and an additional sum was offered for
Howe, dead or alive; for he was now the only
Bush-ranger abroad, and his fall most probably
would put an end to that system of murder and
robbery, which paralyzed trade, and terrified every
inhabitant of the settlement.</p>

<p>“I was now determined to make a push for the
capture of this villain; for which I was promised a
passage to England in the next ship that sailed,
and the amount of the reward laid upon his head.
I found out a man of the name of Warburton, who
was in the habit of hunting kangaroos for their
skins, and who had frequently met Howe during
his excursions, and sometimes furnished him with
ammunition. He gave me such an account of
Howe’s habits, that I felt convinced, we could
take him with a little assistance. I therefore
spoke to a man of the name of Pugh, belonging to
the 48th regiment&mdash;one whom I knew was a most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
cool and resolute fellow; he immediately entered
into my views, and having applied to Major Bell,
his commanding officer, he was recommended by
him to the Governor, by whom I was permitted
to act, and allowed to join us; so he and I went
directly to Warburton, who heartily entered into
the scheme, and all things were arranged for putting
it into execution. The plan was thus:&mdash;Pugh
and I were to remain in Warburton’s hut,
while Warburton himself was to fall into Howe’s
way. The hut was on the banks of the river
Shannon, standing so completely by itself, and
so out of the track of any body who might be
feared by Howe, that there was every probability
of accomplishing our wishes, and ‘<i>scotch the snake</i>,’&mdash;as
they say&mdash;if not kill it. Pugh and I accordingly
proceeded to the appointed hut: we arrived
there before day-break, and having made a hearty
breakfast, Warburton set out to seek Howe: he
took no arms with him, in order to still more
effectually carry his point; but Pugh and I were
provided with muskets and pistols.</p>

<p>“The sun had been just an hour up, when we
saw Warburton and Howe upon the top of a hill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
coming towards the hut. We expected they would
be with us in a quarter of an hour, and so we sat
down upon the trunk of a tree, inside the hut,
calmly waiting their arrival. An hour passed, but
they did not come; so I crept to the door cautiously
and peeped out&mdash;there I saw them standing,
within a hundred yards of us, in earnest conversation:
as I learnt afterwards, the delay arose from
Howe’s suspecting that all was not right. I drew
back from the door to my station; and in about
ten minutes after this we plainly heard footsteps,
and the voice of Warburton;&mdash;another moment,
and Howe slowly entered the hut&mdash;his gun presented
and cocked. The instant he spied us, he
cried out, ‘<i>Is that your game?</i>’&mdash;and immediately
fired; but Pugh’s activity prevented the shot from
taking effect, for he knocked the gun aside. Howe
ran off like a wolf. I fired, but missed. Pugh then
halted, and took aim at him, but also missed. I immediately
flung away the gun, and ran after Howe.
Pugh also pursued&mdash;Warburton was a considerable
distance away. I ran very fast&mdash;so did Howe;
and if he had not fallen down an unexpected bank,
I should not have been fleet enough for him:&mdash;this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
fall, however, brought me up with him;&mdash;he was
on his legs, and preparing to climb a broken bank,
which would have given him a free run into a
wood, when I presented my pistol at him, and desired
him to stand: he drew forth another, but did
not level it at me. We were about fifteen yards
from each other&mdash;the bank he fell from between us.
He stared at me with astonishment; and, to tell
you the truth, I was a little astonished at him; for
he was covered with patches of kangaroo skins, and
wore a long black beard&mdash;a haversack and powder-horn
slung across his shoulders. I wore my beard
also&mdash;as I do now; and a curious pair we looked
like. After a moment’s pause, he cried out, ‘Black
beard against grey beard, for a million!’&mdash;and
fired:&mdash;I slapped at him; and, I believe, hit him;
for he staggered; but rallied again, and was clearing
the bank between him and me, when Pugh ran
up, and with the butt end of his firelock knocked
him down again, jumped after him, and battered
his brains out, just as he was opening a clasp
knife to defend himself.</p>

<p>“This was the fate of the last and most ferocious
of the Bush-rangers&mdash;a villain, who never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
was known to have done an act of humanity, and
who had coolly murdered numbers of his fellow-creatures.”</p>

<p>[“Well; did you get the reward, for ridding the
world of the rascal?” demanded Sergeant Dobson.]</p>

<p>“Yes; the reward was divided amongst Pugh,
Warburton, and myself; but we got subscriptions
from the settlers, to twice the amount; and I
was sent home free, with the thanks of the Governor
and the public.”</p>

<p>[“By my soul, you desarved all you got,” said
Corporal O’Callaghan. “Did you carry the fellow’s
body with you?”]</p>

<p>“No; we buried the body, but took off the
head and brought it to Hobart Town, where it was
exhibited to the crowd&mdash;and no wondering wild
beast ever excited more curiosity. We found in his
haversack a sort of book made of kangaroo skin,
and his dreams written in it with kangaroo blood.
There was also a memorandum of what seeds and
plants he wanted, in case he established a secure
residence for himself in the wild country.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“By George! he was the most extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
fellow, except <i>Three Fingered Jack</i>, that ever I
heard of,” said Dobson.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was the broth of a boy!” observed
the Corporal.&mdash;“And have you lived long in Ireland?”</p>

<p>“Ever since my return from Van Diemen’s
Land&mdash;that may be about fifteen years. I told
you that I was born in this country, but left it
very young: however, when I returned I found
my only relations were a niece and her daughter;
so I took them to keep my cabin for me&mdash;where
we live, thank God, very comfortably.”</p>

<p>“What’s your grand-niece’s name?” demanded
Jack Andrews.&mdash;</p>

<p>At this moment the officer of the rounds challenged,
and the guard turned out. The night was
now clear&mdash;the weather calm&mdash;so Old Worral took
his parting drop from the Corporal, and trudged
on towards his cabin.</p>

<p>As the regiment to which the guard belonged
was to march at daylight, having the day before received
orders to proceed to Plymouth, and there
embark for Portugal, little was talked about in
the guard-house after the old man went away, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
the parting with acquaintances, and the forthcoming
campaign in that country where they had
so long toiled.</p>

<p>At half-past five they marched from Ballycraggen
guard-house to the main street in the little
town, where the regiment was already forming,
and the baggage packed on fifteen or twenty
cars&mdash;all pressed the day before for this service.
The route had arrived very unexpectedly, owing
to the invasion of Portugal by the rebel chief, the
Marquis de Chaves, and the consequent energy
and decision of Mr. Canning in sending out assistance
to that country; on this account no regiment
relieved that stationed at Ballycraggen, and
the guard-house was now deserted; the old oak
chair in which the sergeant of the guard usually
sat, and the wooden forms, were removed&mdash;nothing
remained to inform the accidental visitor of the
cottage, that it once was a military occupation, but
the names of sundry soldiers, and the description
of their <i>rank</i>, delineated on the wall by a burnt
stick.</p>

<p>Early as the hour was, the townspeople were all
up, and waiting to see the regiment march off.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
The glass&mdash;the parting glass&mdash;of strong whisky
was doing its duty briskly; the officers were
bustling about; the soldiers wives sorrowful
enough, mounted on the baggage, with their children&mdash;many
of them were to be left behind the
regiment on embarkation, and none of them knew
which. Little groups were here and there detached
from the ground on which the regiment was to
form, generally composed of soldiers and a few of
the people with whom they had been on habits of
intimacy. Several couples of lovers stood interestingly
conversing, or in melancholy silence: among
these was a young soldier and a remarkably pretty
girl&mdash;she was weeping, while he held her hand and
endeavoured to sooth her almost breaking heart.
This was Jack Andrews and this his sweetheart
to whom he was betrothed:&mdash;they were to have
been married in a few weeks, when the route came
which was now about to separate them for a considerable
time&mdash;if not for ever. Her mother now
came up to her, and although evidently affected
at her daughter’s situation, put on an appearance
of gaiety which only made things worse. Andrews
loved the girl, and it is but just to say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
she was worthy of his most tender regard:
all the town, as well as the regiment, knew of
their attachment. The girl had two hundred
pounds fortune. Jack Andrews was to have purchased
his discharge, and to have settled in Ireland,
along with Ellen Hart (that was her name).
All her friends highly approved of the match; for
Jack was as amiable and as good-looking a man as
any in the regiment to which he belonged. Corporal
Callaghan, having dispatched his own affairs
with those numerous acquaintances which a fellow
of his peculiarly pleasant and sociable qualities
must naturally possess, when domiciled for a very
considerable time in an Irish country town, now
came up to Andrews, and tapping him on the
shoulder, exclaimed, “Blood an’ ouns! Jack, my
boy, I’m sorry Ellen Hart is not coming along
with us. Can’t you ax her mother, there, to let her
go?&mdash;Ellen, give us your hand. By the powers!
if I had such another as you, I’d have you up at
the top o’ the baggage, there, with Mrs. Mullowny,
in a jiffy. The divil a toe you should
stay behind me.”</p>

<p>Andrews smiled and sighed; Ellen’s tears only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
fell faster, and her mother was about to reply,
when her attention was arrested by another object.
“Here,” said she, “is my uncle&mdash;poor old man!
he hasn’t seen you this whole year, Ellen; so
don’t be so sorrowful-looking.”</p>

<p>The uncle advanced&mdash;it was Old Worral; and
the astonishment which Andrews felt at finding
him the grand-uncle of his Ellen may be imagined.
Things were briefly explained; and the veteran,
seizing the hand of Andrews as well as that of
Ellen, exclaimed, “I see you are a couple that
ought not to be separated; but I know what the
service is&mdash;no woman can be certain of permission
to embark with her husband; therefore you must
be patient, and hope to be united soon. Young
man, you are going to a foreign country, to meet
the dangers of the field, and I am on the verge
of the grave&mdash;we may or may not meet again:
but here, before we do part, let me, in the presence
of her mother, give you my consent to marry
my dear Ellen. I see you are a good young man,
and she is worthy of you&mdash;she loves you, and,
from what I hear, I have no doubt you love her;&mdash;there;
I give her to you, and two hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
pounds,&mdash;the savings of a long life. If you return
safe from Portugal, and marry my dear little
Ellen&mdash;if you both come happily together, and
that it please God to put me under ground before
that time&mdash;all I ask is, that you drink poor Old
Worrel’s health, and be kind to Ellen Hart.”</p>

<p>“That I will,” said Andrews, as he took up
his musket, which he had placed against a tree&mdash;for
the regiment was ordered to fall in, the drums
were beating, and the parting word passing from
many. After an instant’s pause, he took the hand
of the old man, and with great emotion said,
“O! take care of her,” then pressed once more his
Ellen to his breast: neither he nor she spoke a
word&mdash;they could not; but their hearts beat closely
together, and right well understood each other.
The old man and the mother of the girl stood
gazing sorrowfully; and even O’Callaghan’s eyes
were about to betray him into weakness. The
lovers separated; and with the blessing of the
old soldier and his niece, Jack Andrews and the
Corporal hastened to fall into the ranks. All was
now ready&mdash;the commanding officer gave the word
“<i>Quick, March!</i>”&mdash;the band struck up “<i>The girl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
I left behind me</i>,”&mdash;and with three huzzas from
the crowd, the gallant soldiers marched off from
Ballycraggen, to take, once more, the field against
the enemies of their country.</p>

It is very common for the wounded to cheer their more fortunate
comrades as they pass on to the attack. The most remarkable
occurrence of this description took place at the battle of Vimiera,
five days after the battle above described. A man of the name of
Stuart, the piper belonging to the 71st regiment, was wounded
in the thigh very severely, at an early period of the action; and
having refused to be removed, he sat upon a bank, playing martial
airs during the remainder of the battle. He was heard to address
his comrades thus:&mdash;“<i>Weel, my bra’ lads, I can gang na’ longer
wi’ ye a fightin’, but Deel burn my saul if ye shall want music</i>.”
For this the Highland Society justly voted him a handsome set of
pipes with a flattering inscription engraved upon them.</p></div>

The author of “the Subaltern,” says that the day the town was
taken, was dark and tempestuous: the morning, perhaps, might
have begun so; but from nine o’clock, it was to my recollection a
sunny and delightful day. However, I agree with him when he
says that the weather was bad, the day Soult attempted to push
across the Bidassoa, to relieve San Sebastian&mdash;I know that the
Portuguese who were ordered from the siege, to assist in opposing
him, were wetted through just as they started; but I think
this was not on the day of storming the town.</p></div>

The author of the “Subaltern” has gone too far in heightening
the horrors of the siege, by stating that it was burnt; his
words are “long before midnight it was one sheet of flame, and
by noon on the <i>following</i> day, little remained of it except its
smoking ashes.” I walked about the town many times on the
<i>following day</i>, but saw no marks of fire; perhaps the town was
<i>subsequently</i> burnt.</p></div>

Officers of the army, in the transactions which may require
the interference of an agent, cannot be too much on their guard
against a set of pretenders who prowl about the Horse Guards for
“clients,” in order to lay them under heavy contributions. They
are persons of neither substance nor character: their usual practice
is to scrape acquaintance with military officers, and artfully
learn their intentions regarding exchanging, promotion, &amp;c., and
positively promise to obtain their wishes. Thus they manage to
draw money from the dupe, which he finds very hard to get back
again. They generally pretend to be officers on half-pay; and
some, I am sorry to say, are of that body.</p>

<p>The best house decidedly for the half-pay or pensions to do
business with, is Window’s, of Craig’s Court. It is a house of
long standing&mdash;of wealth and respectability; and officers will
there be certain of the most liberal treatment. Not only has he
obliged the half-pay by advancing their quarterly stipend, but, in
many instances, a much larger sum, without any indemnity,
except the officer’s honour. In this respect, Mr. Window far
exceeds Cox and Greenwood: the latter are very liberal: but
their liberality is confined to the full-pay.</p></div>

A term given by the Bush-rangers to a dreary flat, called
“<i>Murderer’s Plains</i>.” The following statement, sworn before
A. W. H. Humphrey, Esq., Justice of Peace in New Norfolk,
Van Diemen’s Land, mentions this; and as the statement shows
very strongly the daring spirit of the Bush-rangers, I copy it.&mdash;It
is from a daily journal, called “<i>The Bengal Hurkaru</i>.”</p>

<p>“John Yorke being duly sworn, states&mdash;about five o’clock
in the evening of November 27, (1816) I fell in with a party of
Bush-rangers, about fourteen men and two women; Michael
Howe and Geary were the only two of the gang I knew personally.
I met them on Scantling’s Plains&mdash;I was on horseback;
they desired me to stop, which I accordingly did on the high
road&mdash;it was Geary that stopped me; he said he wanted to see
every man sworn to abide by the contents of a letter. I observed
a thick man writing, as I suppose, to the Lieutenant-governor.
Geary was the man who administered the oath on a
prayer-book, calling each man for that purpose regularly&mdash;they
did not inform me the contents of the letter. Michael Howe
and Geary directed me to state when I came home, the whole
I had seen, and to inform Mr. Humphrey, the magistrate, and
Mr. Wade, the chief constable, to take care of themselves, as
they were resolved to take their lives, and to prevent them from
keeping stock or grain, unless there was something done for
them&mdash;that Mr. Humphrey might rear what grain he liked, but
they would thrash more in one night, than he could reap in a year.
They said they could set the whole country on fire with one stick.
I was detained about three-quarters of an hour, during which
time they charged me to be strict in making known what they
said to me, and what I had seen. On my return from Port
Dalrymple, I called at a hut occupied by Joseph Wright, at
Scantling’s Plains; William Williams, and a youth, were there,
who told me the Bush-rangers had been there a few days before,
and forced them to a place called <i>Murderer’s Plains</i> (which the
Bush-rangers called the <i>Tallow Chandler’s Shop</i>), where they
made them remain three days, for the purpose of rendering down
a large quantity of beef fat, which Williams understood was
taken from cattle belonging to Stynes and Troy.”

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
